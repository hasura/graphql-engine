# Hasura Cloud Preview Apps GitHub Action

## TL;DR

With Preview Apps you can automatically create an app on Hasura Cloud for every pull request you make to your GitHub
repo enabling quick and easy testing of changes as you work.

## Introduction

Hasura Cloud enables automatically creating Preview Apps with Migrations and Metadata from a branch on a GitHub repo by
triggering a new deployment using the official
[Hasura Cloud Preview Apps](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/hasura-cloud-preview-apps) GitHub action.

:::info Note

This feature is currently in beta. Please reach out on our support channels with any questions or concerns or open
an issue on the [Hasura Cloud Preview Apps](https://github.com/hasura/hasura-cloud-preview-apps) GitHub action
repository.

:::

## GitHub Action Workflow steps

This GitHub Action will do the following:

- Clones the repository from the given branch.
- Creates a Hasura Cloud Preview App and applies the Migrations and Metadata. Refer to
  [the GitHub action docs](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/hasura-cloud-preview-apps) for more options.
- Provides the following action outputs in the workflow so that you can use them for the subsequent jobs:
  - `graphQLEndpoint`: GraphQL endpoint of the created Hasura Cloud project.
  - `consoleURL`: Console URL of the created Hasura Cloud project.
  - `projectName`: Name of the created Hasura Cloud project.
  - `projectId`: The project ID of the created Hasura Cloud project.
- Comments on the pull request in the configured format.

For more detailed information, please refer to the GitHub action docs
[action docs](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/hasura-cloud-preview-apps).

:::info Usage Limit

For users with only `Free` tier projects on Hasura Cloud, usage of the Preview App API is limited to 60 calls per
month. More plans are coming soon.

## Configure the Hasura Cloud Preview Apps GitHub Action

Follow the steps below to configure the Hasura Cloud Preview Apps GitHub Action in your GitHub repository.

<TOCInline toc={toc} filterTOC={(tocTree) => tocTree[1].children} />

### Step 1: Create a Hasura Cloud Personal Token {#step-1}

Personal Access Tokens are used to authenticate requests made to Hasura Cloud APIs. A personal access token can be
created by navigating to `Account Settings` section by clicking the button `My Account` on the bottom left of your
Hasura Cloud dashboard and selecting the `Access Tokens` submenu.

  alt="Create a Hasura Cloud personal access token"
/>

Copy the generated personal access token, this will be needed in further steps.

### Step 2: Add a Hasura Cloud personal token to GitHub repository secrets {#step-2}

On GitHub, navigate to the repository with which you want to set up the Hasura Cloud Preview Apps GitHub Action and
select the `Settings` tab.

Select `Secrets` from the submenu on the left and click `Actions`. Click on `New repository secret` to add a new secret.

  alt="Create Access Token"
  width="1146px"
/>

Populate the `Name` field with `HASURA_CLOUD_ACCESS_TOKEN` and `Value` field with the personal access token
generated in step 1 and click `Add secret` to save.

### Step 3: Database setup {#step-3}

Hasura Preview Apps apply Migrations and Metadata on new database/s. This means that new database(s) are required for
each Preview App.

If you use a Postgres database, the Hasura Cloud Preview Apps GitHub Action can create fresh, ephemeral databases
for use in the Preview App, using the provided connection string to your Postgres server. The corresponding
connection string of this fresh database gets added in the Hasura Cloud's project env vars as defined in the action's
`PG_ENV_VARS_FOR_HASURA` env var.

Some points to keep in mind to ensure this works:

1. The Postgres server should accept connections over the internet. You can follow
   [this guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-postgresql-on-ubuntu-20-04) to
   set up a Postgres server on a Digital Ocean droplet or on a VM provided by another vendor of your choice.

:::info Note

To use Postgres in SSL mode, please provide the `sslmode=require` key-value pair as the last parameter in the
connection string. Eg: `postgresql://username:password@host:port/dbname?key=value&sslmode=require`.
:::

2. In the Hasura Cloud Preview App Action's configuration YAML file, under the `postgresDBConfig` key,
   `POSTGRES_SERVER_CONNECTION_URI` and `PG_ENV_VARS_FOR_HASURA` must be configured.

- `POSTGRES_SERVER_CONNECTION_URI`: Connection URI of your Postgres through which the action will create fresh
  ephemeral databases on your Postgres server. It's recommended that you not provide the value in the configuration
  file itself, instead the connection URI should be added to the respective GitHub repository's secret, as
  done in [Step 2](/graphql/cloud/deployment/preview-apps-github-action.mdx#step-2) for a personal access token, in
  order to keep it secure.

- `PG_ENV_VARS_FOR_HASURA`: This key accepts Hasura Cloud env vars corresponding to the Postgres data sources to be
  automatically populated by the action in the Hasura Cloud Project created for the Preview App. These env vars are
  typically referenced in your Hasura Metadata. When the action creates new ephemeral databases, the env vars defined
  here will get populated with the connection URI corresponding to the new ephemeral databases.

A sample configuration for the above two keys in the action's configuration file would look like this:

```yaml
postgresDBConfig: |
  POSTGRES_SERVER_CONNECTION_URI=${{secrets.POSTGRES_SERVER_CONNECTION_URI}}
  PG_ENV_VARS_FOR_HASURA=PG_DB_URL_1,PG_DB_URL_2, PG_DB_URL3
```

The above snippet will create three temporary databases and expose their connection string to the created Preview
App through `PG_DB_URL1`, `PG_DB_URL2` and `PG_DB_URL3` Hasura Cloud env vars.

:::info

If you use databases other than Postgres, you can create the ephemeral databases yourself and pass the env vars in
the `hasuraEnv` field of the action's configuration file.

:::

### Step 4: Add a workflow to your GitHub repo

For creating the action's configuration file, we have created a
[YAML generator](https://cloud.hasura.io/preview-apps-yaml-generator) to ease the process of creating one.

1. Navigate to the
   [Hasura Cloud Preview Apps GitHub Action YAML Generator](https://cloud.hasura.io/preview-apps-yaml-generator).

<Thumbnail

  alt="Create Access Token"
  width="1146px"
/>

2. Populate the fields as per the required configuration and click `Generate YAML`.

| Field                                          | YAML key                                                                                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Repository Name                                | under `hasura/hasura-cloud-preview-apps` job: `name`                                               | The GitHub repository to be configured with this action, without the author/organisation name. For example, if the repo is located at `https://github.com/JaneDoe/test-repo`, the input to the field will be `test-repo`. |
| Path to Hasura Project (in repo)               | under `hasura/hasura-cloud-preview-apps` job: `hasuraProjectDirectoryPath`                         | Path to the Hasura project directory (typically created by the Hasura CLI) containing Migrations and Metadata. The path should be relative to the project's root directory.                                       |
| Project Region                                 | under `hasura/hasura-cloud-preview-apps` job: `region` and `tier`                                  | Hasura Cloud project region to create projects in. The regions are available in two tiers: `Free` tier and `Standard` tier across various regions, and under two cloud providers: AWS and GCP.                             |
| Environment Variables                          | under `hasura/hasura-cloud-preview-apps` job: `hasuraEnv`                                          | Env vars to be set in the Hasura Cloud project created.                                                                                                                                                            |

If you do not want a comment to be posted, clear this field.                                                               |
| Postgres Connection URI                        | under `hasura/hasura-cloud-preview-apps` job: `postgresDBConfig`: `POSTGRES_SERVER_CONNECTION_URI` | Postgres server connection URI. For more information, check [Step 3](/graphql/cloud/deployment/preview-apps-github-action.mdx#step-3).                                                                             |
| Ephemeral Database Setup: Environment Variable | under `hasura/hasura-cloud-preview-apps` job: `postgresDBConfig`: `PG_ENV_VARS_FOR_HASURA`         | Environment variables for connecting to your newly created databases. For more information, check [Step 3](/graphql/cloud/deployment/preview-apps-github-action.mdx#step-3).                                      |

By default, the generated YAML gets triggered on all pull requests to the `main` branch and on pushes to the `main` branch. If you'd like to alter this, please change the generated YAMl appropriately. Please refer the [official GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#on) for more information.

3. Create a file `.github/workflows/hasura-cloud-preview-app.yml` and populate it with the content generated above.

A sample file would look like this:

```yaml
name: 'preview-apps'
on: # rebuild any PRs and main branch changes
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
jobs:
  hasura-cloud-preview:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: hasura/hasura-cloud-preview-apps@v0.1.7
        with:
          name: "preview-repo-name-${{github.env.GITHUB_HEAD_REF}}${{github.event.number}}"
          postgresDBConfig: |
            POSTGRES_SERVER_CONNECTION_URI=${{secrets.POSTGRES_SERVER_CONNECTION_URI}}
            PG_ENV_VARS_FOR_HASURA=PG_DB_URL_1,PG_DB_URL_2,PG_DB_URL3
          hasuraProjectDirectoryPath: hasura
          region: us-west-1
          tier: cloud_free
          hasuraEnv: |
            ENV_VAR_1=value_1
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}
          HASURA_CLOUD_ACCESS_TOKEN: ${{secrets.HASURA_CLOUD_ACCESS_TOKEN}}
      - uses: hasura/comment-progress@v2.1.0
        with:
          github-token: ${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}
          id: preview_app_comment
          number: ${{github.event.number}}
          repository: ${{env.GITHUB_REPOSITORY}}
          message: |
            Console URL available at ${{steps.hasura_cloud_preview.outputs.consoleURL}}
            GraphQL Endpoint available at ${{steps.hasura_cloud_preview.outputs.graphQLEndpoint}}
```

### Step 5: Set up the deletion of Preview Apps

You can set up cleanup for the above workflow. Preview apps, along with the ephemeral databases created for it, need
to be deleted to avoid unnecessary costs.

Create a file `.github/workflows/delete-hasura-cloud-preview-app.yml` in your git repo and add the following code:

```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [closed]

jobs:
  delete:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Hasura Cloud Preview Apps
        uses: hasura/hasura-cloud-preview-apps@v0.1.5
        with:
          name: "repo-name-${{github.env.GITHUB_HEAD_REF}}${{github.event.number}}"
          postgresDBConfig: |
            POSTGRES_SERVER_CONNECTION_URI=${{secrets.POSTGRES_SERVER_CONNECTION_URI}}
            PG_ENV_VARS_FOR_HASURA=PG_DB_URL_1,PG_DB_URL_2,PG_DB_URL3
          delete: true
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}} # ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} is provided by default by GitHub actions
          HASURA_CLOUD_ACCESS_TOKEN: ${{secrets.HASURA_CLOUD_ACCESS_TOKEN}} # Hasura Cloud access token to contact Hasura Cloud APIs
```

This will make sure that whenever the pull request is closed, the Preview App gets deleted.

:::info Note

If you have used `postgresDBConfig` in the creation workflow, make sure that you also include it in the deletion
workflow so that the created databases get deleted when the pull request gets closed/merged.
