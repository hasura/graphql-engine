# Tables

- Should be in Markdown syntax due to its convenience to read as a table in code.
- If markdown syntax becomes difficult to edit due to length, then use JSX syntax.

<!-- We should include some exmaples here...the syntax needed for <table /> to
render in *.md is ugly but necessary for those behemoth tables. -->
