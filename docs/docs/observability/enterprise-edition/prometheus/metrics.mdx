## Metrics exported

The following metrics are exported by Hasura GraphQL Engine:

### GraphQL request metrics

#### Hasura GraphQL execution time seconds

Execution time of successful GraphQL requests (excluding subscriptions). If more requests are falling in the higher
buckets, you should consider [tuning the performance](/deployment/performance-tuning.mdx).

|        |                                                              |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Name   | `hasura_graphql_execution_time_seconds`                      |
| Type   | Histogram<br /><br />Buckets: 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10 |
| Labels | `operation_type`: query \| mutation                          |

:::info GraphQL request execution time

- Uses wall-clock time, so it includes time spent waiting on I/O.
- Includes authorization, parsing, validation, planning, and execution (calls to databases, Remote Schemas).

:::

#### Hasura GraphQL requests total

Number of GraphQL requests received, representing the GraphQL query/mutation traffic on the server.

|        |                                                                |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Name   | `hasura_graphql_requests_total`                                |
| Type   | Counter                                                        |
| Labels | `operation_type`: query \| mutation \| subscription \| unknown |

The `unknown` operation type will be returned for queries that fail authorization, parsing, or certain validations. The
`response_status` label will be `success` for successful requests and `failed` for failed requests.


### Hasura Event Triggers metrics

See more details on Event trigger observability [here](/event-triggers/observability-and-performance.mdx).

#### Event fetch time per batch

Hasura fetches the events in batches (by default 100) from the Hasura Event tables in the database. This metric
represents the time taken to fetch a batch of events from the database.

A higher metric indicates slower polling of events from the database, you should consider looking into the performance
of your database.

|        |                                                                                            |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Name   | `hasura_event_fetch_time_per_batch_seconds`                                                |
| Type   | Histogram<br /><br />Buckets: 0.0001, 0.0003, 0.001, 0.003, 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10 |
| Labels | none                                                                                       |

#### Event invocations total

This metric represents the number of HTTP requests that have been made to the webhook server for delivering events.

|        |                                                            |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Name   | `hasura_event_invocations_total`                           |
| Type   | Counter                                                    |
| Labels | `status`: success \| failed, `trigger_name`, `source_name` |

#### Event processed total

Total number of events processed. Represents the Event Trigger egress.

|        |                                                            |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Name   | `hasura_event_processed_total`                             |
| Type   | Counter                                                    |
| Labels | `status`: success \| failed, `trigger_name`, `source_name` |

#### Event processing time

Time taken for an event to be processed.

|        |                                                                       |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Name   | `hasura_event_processing_time_seconds`                                |
| Type   | Histogram<br /><br />Buckets: 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10, 30, 100 |
| Labels | `trigger_name`, `source_name`                                         |

The processing of an event involves the following steps:

1.  Hasura Engine fetching the event from Hasura Event tables in the database and adding it to the Hasura Events queue
2.  An HTTP worker picking up the event from the Hasura Events queue
3.  An HTTP worker delivering the event to the webhook

:::info Event delivery failure

Note, if the delivery of the event fails - the delivery of the event is retried based on its `next_retry_at`
configuration.

:::

This metric represents the time taken for an event to be delivered since it was created (if the first attempt) or retried
(after the first attempt). **This metric can be considered as the end-to-end processing time for an event.**

For e.g., say an event was created at `2021-01-01 10:00:30` and it has a `next_retry_at` configuration which says if the
event delivery fails, the event should be retried after 30 seconds.

At `2021-01-01 10:01:30`: the event was fetched from the Hasura Event tables, picked up by the HTTP worker, and the
delivery was attempted. The delivery failed and the `next_retry_at` of `2021-01-01 10:02:00` was set for the event.

Now at `2021-01-01 10:02:00`: the event was fetched again from the Hasura Event tables, picked up by the HTTP worker,
and the delivery was attempted at `2021-01-01 10:03: 30`. This time, the delivery was successful.

The processing time for the second delivery try would be:

Processing Time = event delivery time - event next retried time

Processing Time = `2021-01-01 10:03:30` - `2021-01-01 10:02:00` = `90 seconds`

#### Event queue time

Hasura fetches the events from the Hasura Event tables in the database and adds it to the Hasura Events queue. The event
queue time represents the time taken for an event to be picked up by the HTTP worker after it has been added to the
"Events Queue".

Higher value of this metric implies slow event processing. In this case, you can consider increasing the
[HTTP pool size](/deployment/graphql-engine-flags/reference.mdx/#events-http-pool-size) or optimizing the webhook
server.

|        |                                                                       |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Name   | `hasura_event_queue_time_seconds`                                     |
| Type   | Histogram<br /><br />Buckets: 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10, 30, 100 |
| Labels | `trigger_name`, `source_name`                                         |

#### Event Triggers HTTP Workers

Current number of active Event Trigger HTTP workers. Compare this number to the
[HTTP pool size](/deployment/graphql-engine-flags/reference.mdx/#events-http-pool-size). Consider increasing it if the
metric is near the current configured value.

|        |                                     |
| ------ | ----------------------------------- |
| Name   | `hasura_event_trigger_http_workers` |
| Type   | Gauge                               |
| Labels | none                                |

#### Event webhook processing time

The time between when an HTTP worker picks an event for delivery to the time it sends the event payload to the webhook.

A higher processing time indicates slow webhook, you should try to optimize the event webhook.

|        |                                                              |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Name   | `hasura_event_webhook_processing_time_seconds`               |
| Type   | Histogram<br /><br />Buckets: 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10 |
| Labels | `trigger_name`, `source_name`                                |

#### Events fetched per batch

Number of events fetched from the Hasura Event tables in the database per batch. This number should be equal or less
than the [events fetch batch size](/deployment/graphql-engine-flags/reference.mdx/#events-fetch-batch-size).

|        |                                   |
| ------ | --------------------------------- |
| Name   | `hasura_events_fetched_per_batch` |
| Type   | Gauge                             |
| Labels | none                              |

Since polling the database to continuously check if there are any pending events is an expensive operation, Hasura only
polls the database if there are any pending events. This metric can be used to understand if there are any pending
events in the Hasura Event Tables.

:::info Dependent on pending events

Note that Hasura only fetches events from the Hasura Event tables if there are any pending events. If there are no
pending events, this metric will be 0.

### Subscription metrics

See more details on subscriptions observability [here](/subscriptions/observability-and-performance.mdx).

#### Active Subscriptions

Current number of active subscriptions, representing the subscription load on the server.

|        |                                                                                            |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Name   | `hasura_active_subscriptions`                                                              |
| Type   | Gauge                                                                                      |
| Labels | `subscription_kind`: streaming \| live-query, `operation_name`, `parameterized_query_hash` |

#### Active Subscription Pollers

Current number of active subscription pollers. A subscription poller
[multiplexes](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/blob/master/architecture/live-queries.md#idea-3-batch-multiple-live-queries-into-one-sql-query)
similar subscriptions together. The value of this metric should be proportional to the number of uniquely parameterized
subscriptions (i.e., subscriptions with the same selection set, but with different input arguments and session variables
are multiplexed on the same poller). If this metric is high then it may be an indication that there are too many
uniquely parameterized subscriptions which could be optimized for better performance.

|        |                                              |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| Name   | `hasura_active_subscription_pollers`         |
| Type   | Gauge                                        |
| Labels | `subscription_kind`: streaming \| live-query |

#### Active Subscription Pollers in Error State

Current number of active subscription pollers that are in the error state. A subscription poller
[multiplexes](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/blob/master/architecture/live-queries.md#idea-3-batch-multiple-live-queries-into-one-sql-query)
similar subscriptions together. A non-zero value of this metric indicates that there are runtime errors in atleast one
of the subscription pollers that are running in Hasura. In most of the cases, runtime errors in subscriptions are caused
due to the changes at the data model layer and fixing the issue at the data model layer should automatically fix the
runtime errors.

|        |                                                     |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Name   | `hasura_active_subscription_pollers_in_error_state` |
| Type   | Gauge                                               |
| Labels | `subscription_kind`: streaming \| live-query        |

#### Subscription Total Time

The time taken to complete running of one subscription poller.

A subscription poller
[multiplexes](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/blob/master/architecture/live-queries.md#idea-3-batch-multiple-live-queries-into-one-sql-query)
similar subscriptions together. This subscription poller runs every 1 second by default and queries the database with
the multiplexed query to fetch the latest data. In a polling instance, the poller not only queries the database but does
other operations like splitting similar queries into batches (by default 100) before fetching their data from the
database, etc. **This metric is the total time taken to complete all the operations in a single poll.**

In a single poll, the subscription poller splits the different variables for the multiplexed query into batches (by
default 100) and executes the batches. We use the `hasura_subscription_db_execution_time_seconds` metric to observe the
time taken for each batch to execute on the database. This means for a single poll there can be multiple values for
`hasura_subscription_db_execution_time_seconds` metric.

Let's look at an example to understand these metrics better:

Say we have 650 subscriptions with the same selection set but different input arguments. These 650 subscriptions will be
grouped to form one multiplexed query. A single poller would be created to run this multiplexed query. This poller will
run every 1 second.

The default batch size in hasura is 100, so the 650 subscriptions will be split into 7 batches for execution during a
single poll.

During a single poll:

- Batch 1: `hasura_subscription_db_execution_time_seconds` = 0.002 seconds
- Batch 2: `hasura_subscription_db_execution_time_seconds` = 0.001 seconds
- Batch 3: `hasura_subscription_db_execution_time_seconds` = 0.003 seconds
- Batch 4: `hasura_subscription_db_execution_time_seconds` = 0.001 seconds
- Batch 5: `hasura_subscription_db_execution_time_seconds` = 0.002 seconds
- Batch 6: `hasura_subscription_db_execution_time_seconds` = 0.001 seconds
- Batch 7: `hasura_subscription_db_execution_time_seconds` = 0.002 seconds

The `hasura_subscription_total_time_seconds` would be sum of all the database execution times shown in the batches, plus
some extra process time for other tasks the poller does during a single poll. In this case, it would be approximately
0.013 seconds.

|        |                                                                                            |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Name   | `hasura_subscription_total_time_seconds`                                                   |
| Type   | Histogram<br /><br />Buckets: 0.000001, 0.0001, 0.01, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10, 30, 100          |
| Labels | `subscription_kind`: streaming \| live-query, `operation_name`, `parameterized_query_hash` |

#### Subscription Database Execution Time

The time taken to run the subscription's multiplexed query in the database for a single batch.

A subscription poller
[multiplexes](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/blob/master/architecture/live-queries.md#idea-3-batch-multiple-live-queries-into-one-sql-query)
similar subscriptions together. During every run (every 1 second by default), the poller splits the different variables
for the multiplexed query into batches (by default 100) and execute the batches. This metric observes the time taken for
each batch to execute on the database.

If this metric is high, then it may be an indication that the database is not performing as expected, you should
consider investigating the subscription query and see if indexes can help improve performance.

|        |                                                                                            |
