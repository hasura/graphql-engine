If you need a binary for Hasura GraphQL engine to run in a non-Docker environment or you require
custom Docker images for reasons such as, the default base image *(alpine)* is not compatible with your security scanning tool
(`Anchore <https://anchore.com/>`_, `Sysdig Secure <https://sysdig.com/products/kubernetes-security/image-scanning/>`_, etc.),
we can make them available via a support plan.

To set up this support plan, please contact us using the form on our
`contact us page <https://hasura.io/contact-us/>`_ and mention the Linux flavor
(*CentOS, Debian slim, etc.*) or the target architecture for the binary you'd be
interested in.

A custom image will be made available for every stable release of GraphQL engine.
