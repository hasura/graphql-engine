-- | The @BackendEventTrigger@ type class contains functions which
--   interact with the source database to perform event trigger related
--   operations like fetching pending events from the database or
--   inserting a new invocation log after processing an event.
class Backend b => BackendEventTrigger (b :: BackendType) where

  -- | insertManualEvent inserts the specified event
  --   in the event log table, note that this method should
  --   also set the trace context and session variables in the
  --   source database context (if available)

  -- | @fetchUndeliveredEvents@ fetches the undelivered events
  --   from the source and locks the events which are fetched for
  --   processing. The locking is done so that when there are multiple
  --   instances of graphql-engine connected to the same source they don't
  --   end up processing the same events concurrently. Also, it's crucial
  --   that the SQL query used to fetch events in this function uses something like Postgres's
  --   `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` mechanism so that it skips past the events which are locked by the database and pick
  --   newer undelivered events to achieve maximum throughput.
  --
  --   The locking mechanism for event triggers is timestamp based i.e. when an event
  --   is fetched from the database, the `locked` column will contain the timestamp of when
  --   it was fetched from the database. Undelivered events will have `NULL` value as their `locked` column value.
  --   The idea behind having a timestamp based locking mechanism is that if the graphql-engine is shutdown
  --   abruptly with events being fetched by the events processor, it will be locked and after the shutdown it will
  --   remain locked. Now with a timestamp based lock, when the graphql-engine is started again it will also fetch
  --   events which have a `locked` value of older than 30 mins along with the undelivered events. So, this way
  --   no events remain in a `locked` state.
