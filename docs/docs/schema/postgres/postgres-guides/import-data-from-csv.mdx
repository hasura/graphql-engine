# Import Data from CSV into Postgres

## Introduction

You might have existing data stored in a CSV file that you need to import into your Postgres database. The following
guide will show how to do so.

Let's assume we have the following CSV file, which is named `profile.csv`:

## Step 1: Add a corresponding table to your PG database

Let us create a table to match the data structure in your CSV file.

```sql
profile (
  firstName TEXT,
  lastName TEXT,
  email VARCHAR
)
```

## Step 2: Connect to your Postgres database

Connect to your Postgres database by using the `psql` command on the terminal:

```bash
psql postgres://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<database>

# for example
psql postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres
```

## Step 3: Import the data from the CSV file

Once connected to the database, use the following command from inside `psql` to import the data:

```bash
\copy <table_name> from '</path/to/file/filename.csv>' delimiter ',' CSV HEADER;

# for example
\copy profile from '/Users/sarahlewis/documents/profile.csv' delimiter ',' CSV HEADER;
```

Your data would have been successfully copied into the Postgres database.

:::info Values not explicitly provided in the CSV file

If a column's value is auto-generated, you can exclude it from the CSV file and allow the database to populate it
automatically. However, you must make sure that the auto-generated column is defined as such in the table schema.

If a column is not present in the CSV file, you can either set a default value for it in the table schema or exclude it
from the INSERT statement. If the column is not nullable and has no default value, you must provide a value for it in
the INSERT statement.
