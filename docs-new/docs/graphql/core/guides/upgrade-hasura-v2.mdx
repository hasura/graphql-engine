# Updating to Hasura GraphQL engine v2

## Introduction

This page talks about the conceptual changes introduces in Hasura v2 and
things to keep in mind while updating from Hasura v1 to v2.

Do reach out to us if you run into any issues while using Hasura v2 or
have any questions regarding any changes introduced.

## What has changed?

### Concepts

The following are the most significant conceptual changes introduced in
Hasura v2:

-   Hasura v2 can now connect to multiple databases to generate a
    unified GraphQL API. Each connected database will have a unique
    "source name" that is used to identify it. Apart from Postgres,
    connecting to SQL server databases is also now supported.
-   Config for connecting a database used to be a startup configuration
    (i.e. set via env vars/flags) but since v2, it is a part of Hasura
    metadata and can be managed dynamically. See
    [connecting databases](/graphql/core/databases/connect-db.mdx).
-   Hasura metadata can now be stored in a separate dedicated Postgres
    DB.

:::info Note

A detailed changelog with all the new features introduced in Hasura v2
is available on the [releases page](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/releases).

### Breaking behaviour changes {#hasura-v2-behaviour-changes}


<div id="hasura-v2-null-where-change" />


- **Semantics of explicit "null" values in "where" filters have changed**

    According to the discussion in [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/issues/704#issuecomment-635571407),
    an explicit `null` value in a comparison input object will be
    treated as an error rather than resulting in the expression being
    evaluated to `True`.

    For example: The mutation
    `delete_users(where: {id: {_eq: $userId}}) { name }` will yield an
    error if `$userId` is `null` instead of deleting all users.

    The older behaviour can be preserved by setting the
    `HASURA_GRAPHQL_V1_BOOLEAN_NULL_COLLAPSE` env var to `true`.

-   **Semantics of "null" join values in remote schema relationships
    have changed**

    In a remote schema relationship query, the remote schema will be
    queried when all of the joining arguments are not `null` values.
    When there are `null` value(s), the remote schema won't be queried
    and the response of the remote relationship field will be `null`.
    Earlier, the remote schema was queried with the `null` value
    arguments and the response depended upon how the remote schema
    handled the `null` arguments but as per user feedback, this
    behaviour was clearly not expected.

-   **Order of keys in objects passed as "order_by" operator inputs is
    not preserved**

    The `order_by` operator accepts an array of objects as input to
    allow ordering by multiple fields in a given order, i.e.
    `[{field1: sortOrder}, {field2: sortOrder}]` but it is also accepts
    a single object with multiple keys as an input, i.e.
    `{field1: sortOrder, field2: sortOrder}`. In earlier versions,
    Hasura's query parsing logic used to maintain the order of keys in
    the input object and hence the appropriate `order by` clauses with
    the fields in the right order were generated .

    As the [GraphQL spec](http://spec.graphql.org/June2018/#sec-Input-Object-Values)
    mentions that input object keys are unordered, Hasura v2.0's new and
    stricter query parsing logic doesn't maintain the order of keys in
    the input object taking away the guarantee of the generated
    `order by` clauses to have the fields in the given order.

    For example: The query
    `fetch_users(order_by: {age: desc, name: asc}) {id name age}` which
    is intended to fetch users ordered by their age and then by their
    name is now not guaranteed to return results first ordered by age
    and then by their name as the `order_by` input is passed as an
    object. To achieve the expected behaviour, the following query
    `fetch_users(order_by: [{age: desc}, {name: asc}]) {id name age}`
    should be used which uses an array to define the order of fields to
    generate the appropriate `order by` clause.

-   **Type name for computed fields' input argument has changed**

    The name of the computed field input argument has changed from `<function_name>_args`
    to `<computed_field_name>_<table_name>_args`.
    This change enables adding a root-level tracked function as a
    computed field which previously would have thrown an input type
    conflict error.

-   **Hasura APIs generated by older Hasura versions cannot be added as
    Remote Schemas to Hasura v2**

    With v2.0, some of the auto-generated schema types have been
    extended. For example, `String_comparison_exp` has an additional
    `regex` input object field. This means if you have a Hasura API with
    an older Hasura version added as a remote schema then it will have a
    type conflict. You should update all Hasura remote schemas to avoid
    such type conflicts.

-   **CLI Migrations are executed sequentially, instead of one large
    transaction**

    While applying multiple migrations, in earlier Hasura CLI versions
    all migration files were run under one transaction block. i.e. if
    any migration threw an error, all the previously successfully
    executed migrations would be rolled back. With Hasura CLI v2.0, each
    migration file is run in its own transaction block but all the
    migrations are not executed under one. i.e. if any migration throws
    an error, applying further migrations will be stopped but the other
    successfully executed migrations up till that point will not be
    rolled back.


<div id="hasura-v2-env-changes" />


-   **Deprecation of database specific env vars**

    In v2.0, the values of the following env vars are used to define the
    connection parameters of the `default` database while updating an
    existing instance or while starting a fresh instance. During
    metadata initialization, their values are moved to the metadata of
    the `default` database as defined [here](/graphql/core/api-reference/syntax-defs.mdx#pgconfiguration).

    -   `HASURA_GRAPHQL_PG_CONNECTIONS`
    -   `HASURA_GRAPHQL_PG_TIMEOUT`
    -   `HASURA_GRAPHQL_NO_OF_RETRIES`
    -   `HASURA_GRAPHQL_PG_CONN_LIFETIME`
    -   `HASURA_GRAPHQL_PG_POOL_TIMEOUT`
    -   `HASURA_GRAPHQL_USE_PREPARED_STATEMENTS`
    -   `HASURA_GRAPHQL_TX_ISOLATION`
    -   `HASURA_GRAPHQL_READ_REPLICA_URLS`
    -   `HASURA_GRAPHQL_CONNECTIONS_PER_READ_REPLICA`

    **Post the initial setup/update once the metadata is initialized,
    these env vars can be considered as Deprecated.** i.e. Changing or
    setting values of these env vars will have no impact as the values
    in the Hasura metadata are now used to define the connection
    parameters.

### Hasura configuration {#hasura-v2-config-changes}

-   To accommodate changes for storing information for multiple
    databases, the Hasura metadata and the Hasura CLI project versions
    have been bumped from `v2` to `v3`. The `v2` versions of the
    metadata and CLI project can continue to be used with Hasura v2
    instances. Hasura v2 will assume the `v2` metadata and migrations
    belong to a database connected with the name `default`.

-   A new optional env var `HASURA_GRAPHQL_METADATA_DATABASE_URL` is now
    introduced. When set, this Postgres database is used to store the
    Hasura metadata. If not set, the database set using
    `HASURA_GRAPHQL_DATABASE_URL` is used to store the Hasura metadata.

    Either one of `HASURA_GRAPHQL_METADATA_DATABASE_URL` or
    `HASURA_GRAPHQL_DATABASE_URL` needs to be set with a Postgres
    database to start a Hasura v2 instance as Hasura always needs a
    Postgres database to store its metadata.

-   The database set using the `HASURA_GRAPHQL_DATABASE_URL` env var is
    connected automatically with the name `default` in Hasura v2 while
    updating an existing instance or while starting a fresh instance.

    Setting this env var post initial setup/update will have no effect
    as the Hasura metadata for data sources would already have been
    initialized and the env var will be treated as any other custom env
    var.

    It is now not mandatory to set this env var if a dedicated
    `HASURA_GRAPHQL_METADATA_DATABASE_URL` is set.

-   Custom env vars can now be used to connect databases dynamically at
    runtime.

-   With support for multiple databases, older database specific env
    vars have been deprecated. [See details](#hasura-v2-env-changes)

## Moving from Hasura v1 to Hasura v2 {#moving-from-hasura-v1-to-v2}

### Hasura v1 and Hasura v2 compatibility {#hasura-v1-v2-compatibility}

All existing metadata and migrations from a Hasura v1 instance are
assumed to belong to a database named `default` in Hasura v2.

Hence **in Hasura v2, a database with name "default" needs to be added
to apply metadata and migrations from a Hasura v1 instance**.

Post adding a database named `default`, the Hasura v2 instance should
behave equivalently to the Hasura v1 instance and all previous workflows
will continue working as they were.

Refer to [connecting databases](/graphql/core/databases/connect-db.mdx) to add a database to
Hasura v2.

### Migrate Hasura v1 instance to Hasura v2

Hasura v2 is backwards compatible with Hasura v1. Hence simply updating
the Hasura docker image version number and restarting your Hasura
instance should work seamlessly. The database connected using the
`HASURA_GRAPHQL_DATABASE_URL` env var will be added as a database with
the name `default` automatically and all existing metadata and
migrations will be assumed to belong to it.

:::info Note

In case you happen to have a large number of past cron and event trigger
logs in your database, this might slow down the update to v2 and might
even cause unexpected errors in certain scenarios.

**It is highly recommended to clean up past cron and event trigger logs
data from the database before attempting the update if you have a lot of
historical data.**

You can take a dump of this data before cleaning up if you wish to keep
the log history. This data can be restored back into the DB if required
post the update.

:::

## Post update steps {#hasura-v1-to-v2-post-update-steps}

### Remove deprecated ENV Vars

With support for multiple databases, database connection related config
is now stored in Hasura metadata and the older database specific env
vars have been deprecated. [See details](#hasura-v2-env-changes).

Post update to Hasura v2 these env vars can be removed as they will now
be ignored.

This config can now be modified by updating the Hasura metadata for the
connected database(s) via the console/CLI/APIs.

### Upgrade CLI project to enable multiple database and other new features support

Update your Hasura CLI project to `config v3` using the steps mentioned
in [this guide](/graphql/core/migrations/upgrade-v3.mdx) to take full advantages of the
features introduced in Hasura v2.

Post upgrading to `config v3`, the database connection parameters would
have been moved to the metadata. Hence it is important to ensure that
the same env vars are used for storing database connection strings
across all environments and the metadata being applied also uses the
appropriate env vars.

:::info Note

If you do not need multiple database support or any of new features
introduced in Hasura v2, like REST endpoints, inherited roles etc., then
you can continue to use `config v2` project directory and workflows.

Though we would recommend to upgrade to `config v3` anyway as it
includes some useful directory structure changes.

### Updates to CI/CD after updating to Hasura v2

The following commands need to be executed in the specified order to
apply metadata and migrations in CI/CD workflows

-   If using Hasura CLI project in `config v2`:
    -   No changes needed.
    -   Run:
        -   `hasura migrate apply` - *(apply migrations to the database
            named "default")*
        -   `hasura metadata apply` - *(apply metadata to the database
            named "default")*
-   If using Hasura CLI project in `config v3`:
    -   Ensure that the same env vars are used for storing database
        connection strings across all environments and the metadata
        being applied also uses the appropriate env vars.
    -   Run:
        -   `hasura metadata apply` - *(connect Hasura to the databases
            configured in the metadata)*
        -   `hasura migrate apply --all-databases` - *(apply the
            migrations to the connected databases)*
        -   `hasura metadata reload` - *(make Hasura aware of any newly
            created database objects in the previous step)*

## Downgrading back to Hasura v1

In case there are some issues with your Hasura instance post updating to
Hasura v2, you can downgrade back to Hasura v1 by reverting the Hasura
docker image version and using the [downgrade command](/graphql/core/deployment/downgrading.mdx)
to revert the Hasura metadata catalogue changes:

```bash
docker run -e HASURA_GRAPHQL_DATABASE_URL=$POSTGRES_URL hasura/graphql-engine:v2.0.0 graphql-engine downgrade --to-v1.3.3
```

:::info Note

You can downgrade a Hasura v2 instance to Hasura v1 only if there is
only one database connected to it.
