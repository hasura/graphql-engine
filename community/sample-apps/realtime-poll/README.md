# hasura-realtime-poll

A demo application to showcase real-time capabilities of [Hasura GraphQL
Engine](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine).

[![Edit realtime-poll](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/hasura/graphql-engine/tree/master/community/sample-apps/realtime-poll?fontsize=14)

The Realtime Poll application is built using React and is powered by Hasura
GraphQL Engine over Postgres. It has an interface for users to cast vote on a
poll and the results are updated in the on-screen bar chart, in real-time.

The application makes use of Hasura GraphQL Engine's real-time capabilities
using `subscription`. There is no backend code involved. The application is
hosted on GitHub pages and the Postgres+GraphQL Engine is running on Postgres.

- Checkout the [live app](https://realtime-poll.demo.hasura.app/).
- Explore the backend using [Hasura
  Console](https://realtime-poll.hasura.app/console).

# Running the app yourself
