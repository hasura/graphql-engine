For this tutorial, the GraphQL backend and the basic app UI is already ready.
Our task will be to convert the "static" UI into a working realtime app.

### Download and run the boilerplate

1. Download the boilerplate from [https://learn.hasura.io/graphql/angular-apollo/boilerplate.zip](https://learn.hasura.io/graphql/angular-apollo/boilerplate.zip)
2. Unzip and make sure you're in the `app-boilerplate` directory
3. Install dependencies and run the "static" app
    - `npm install`
    - `npm start`
4. Signup/login as a user to load the todo app page

This is what you should see after the steps above:
