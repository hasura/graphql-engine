# Headings & Ids

## Headings

Please follow Good old `h1(#) => h6(######)` hierarchy.

```markdown
# Main page title

## First heading

### Second heading

#### Third heading

##### Fourth heading

###### Fifth heading
```

:::info Note

At any point of time there should only be one `h1` per doc. `h2 => h6` can be any number as required while ensuring correct hierarchy.

:::


## Heading Ids {#heading-ids}

Docusaurus will by default generate an id for each heading to be able to link to individual sections.

The generated id's are nothing but the `kebab-cased-heading-text-itself`.

Ex:

```markdown
## Heading H2 Example

<!-- will have a generated id as below -->
heading-h2-example
```

To link to this section, we can append the id as a `#hash-param` to url.

```markdown
[Link to Sub Section](/path/to/sub/section.mdx#heading-h2-example)`.

<!-- or just the hash-param if its in the same document -->

[Link to sub section in same document](#heading-ids)
```

:::caution Handling changes to heading

This works as long as there is no change in the respective section heading. Updating the heading would require to scan through all the links that points to this section and update every time.

So, to avoid this manual effort and making the links independeent, prefer adding a custom id while linking respective section.

:::


## Handling Custom Ids

Custom Heading Ids are added as `{#kebab-cased-id}`

Prefer `lowercased-kebab-case` for all the ids to maintain consistency.


<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="sphinx" label="Sphinx - RST" default>

```rest {1-4}
.. _create_hasura_project_aws_rds_aurora:

Step 1: Create a Hasura Cloud project
-------------------------------------

On the Hasura Cloud dashboard, create a new project:
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="docusaurus" label="Docusaurus - MDX">

```markdown {1}
## Step 1: Create a Hasura Cloud project {#create-hasura-project-aws-rds-aurora}

On the Hasura Cloud dashboard, create a new project:
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

They can also be generated when required using the cli command [write-heading-ids](https://docusaurus.io/docs/cli#docusaurus-write-heading-ids-sitedir) - Please DO NOT OVERRIDE exisiting ones).

Skip for `h1 (#)` as the top level heading is beginining of file the direct link without `#hash-param` would work fine.


:::danger Please do not add id in frontmatter

Docusaurus by default uses [file path (including folders) without the extension as the id](https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/plugins/@docusaurus/plugin-content-docs#id) and the same will be slug.

If an `id` is added in frontmatter the slug will by default be the id thus breaking the existing URL structure.

This will result in setting up bunch of redirects and will have a impact on SEO and indexed page rankings.

So, Please ignore the id in frontmatter, Let's leave this to docusaurus default behaviour which is great.

In case, if you are not sure of what to do in a different situation. Please let us know, we will help figure out
