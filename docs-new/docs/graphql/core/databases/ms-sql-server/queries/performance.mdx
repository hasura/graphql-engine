# MS SQL Server: Query performance

## Introduction

Sometimes queries can become slow due to large data volumes or levels of
nesting. This page explains how to identify the query performance, and
how queries can be optimized.

## Analysing query performance {#ms-sql-server-analysing-query-performance}

Let's say we want to analyse the following query:

```graphql
query {
  authors(where: { name: { _eq: "Mario" } }) {
    rating
  }
}
```

In order to analyse the performance of a query, you can click on the
`Analyze` button on the Hasura console:

The following query execution plan is generated:

  alt="Execution plan for Hasura GraphQL query"
  width="800px"
/>

We can see that a sequential scan is conducted on the `authors` table.
This means that MS SQL Server goes through every row of the `authors`
table in order to check if the author's name equals "Mario". The `cost`
of a query is an arbitrary number generated by MS SQL Server and is to
be interpreted as a measure of comparison rather than an absolute
measure of something.

Read more about query performance analysis in the [MS SQL Server explain statement docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/queries/explain-transact-sql?view=azure-sqldw-latest).

## Query optimization

### Using MS SQL indexes {#ms-sql-server-data-validation-mssql-indexes}

[MS SQL Server indexes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/indexes/indexes?view=sql-server-ver15)
are special lookup tables that MS SQL Server can use to speed up data
lookup. An index acts as a pointer to data in a table, and it works very
similar to an index in the back of a book. If you look in the index
first, you'll find the data much quicker than searching the whole book
(or - in this case - database).

Let's say we know that `authors` table is frequently queried by `name`:

```graphql
query {
  authors(where: { name: { _eq: "Mario" } }) {
    rating
  }
}
```

We've seen in the
[above example](#ms-sql-server-analysing-query-performance) that by
default MS SQL Server conducts a sequential scan i.e. going through all
the rows. Whenever there is a sequential scan, it can be optimized by
adding an index.

The following statement sets an index on `name` in the `authors` table.

```plsql
CREATE INDEX ON authors (name);
```

<Tabs className="api-tabs">
<TabItem value="console" label="Console">

An index can be added in the `Data -> SQL` tab in the Hasura console.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

[Create a migration manually](/graphql/core/migrations/advanced/writing-migrations-manually.mdx) and add your create
index statement to the `up.sql` file. Also, add an SQL statement to
revert that statement to the `down.sql` file in case you need to
[roll back](/graphql/core/migrations/advanced/rolling-back-migrations.mdx) the migration.

Apply the migration by running:

```bash
hasura migrate apply
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="api" label="API">

You can add an index by making an API call to the
[schema_run_sql metadata API](/graphql/core/api-reference/schema-api/run-sql.mdx#schema-run-sql):

```http
POST /v2/query HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
X-Hasura-Role: admin

{
   "type": "run_sql",
   "args": {
      "source": "<db-name>",
      "sql": "<create index statement>"
   }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Let's compare the performance analysis to
[the one before adding the index](#ms-sql-server-analysing-query-performance).
What was a `sequential scan` in the example earlier is now an
`index scan`. `Index scans` are usually more performant than
`sequential scans`. We can also see that the `cost` of the query is now
lower than the one before we added the index.

:::info Note

In some cases sequential scans can still be faster than index scans,
e.g. if the result returns a high percentage of the rows in the table.
MS SQL Server comes up with multiple query plans and takes the call on
what kind of scan would be faster.
