# Auto-Apply Migrations and Metadata

## Introduction

Hasura ships a special `cli-migrations` Docker image which can be used to automatically apply Migrations and Metadata
when the server starts.

This Docker image provides a method to implement Migrations and Metadata at the Docker entrypoint automatically. A temporary server is booted,
with the Migrations API allowed, securely through localhost. Once Migrations and Metadata have been applied, the server
will reboot in a secure mode for inbound graphql usage.

You can use this image in your CI/CD workflows to automatically apply Migrations and Metadata to a Hasura GraphQL Engine
instance like this in a Dockerfile:

```bash
FROM hasura/graphql-engine:<version>.cli-migrations-v3

CMD graphql-engine \
  --metadata-database-url $METADATA_DATABASE_URL \
  serve \
  --server-port $PORT \
  --enable-console
```

You can find more information about configuring the `cli-migrations` image
[here](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/blob/master/packaging/cli-migrations/v3/README.md#metadata-directory-optional)
and find the image on
[DockerHub for various platforms here](https://hub.docker.com/r/hasura/graphql-engine/tags?page=1&name=cli-migrations-v3).

This container image also includes the Hasura CLI at `/bin/hasura-cli` and can be used for running any other CI/CD
scripts in your workflow too.

:::info Note

For `config v2`, see
[Auto-apply Migrations/Metadata when the server starts (config v2)](/migrations-metadata-seeds/legacy-configs/config-v2/advanced/auto-apply-migrations.mdx).

## Applying Migrations

The `migrations` and `metadata` directories created by the Hasura CLI in a Hasura Project can be mounted at the
`/hasura-migrations` and `/hasura-metadata` paths of this Docker container and the container's entrypoint script will
automatically apply the Migrations and Metadata before starting the server. If no directory is mounted at the designated
paths, the server will start and ignore the Migrations and/or Metadata.

You can also mount the Migrations/Metadata directories at some location other than the above by setting the following
environment variables:

```bash
HASURA_GRAPHQL_MIGRATIONS_DIR=/custom-path-for-migrations
HASURA_GRAPHQL_METADATA_DIR=/custom-path-for-metadata
```

Once the Migrations and Metadata are applied, the container resumes operation as a normal Hasura GraphQL Engine server.

Example:

```bash
# Start Hasura after applying the Migrations and Metadata present in the Hasura Project
docker run -p 8080:8080 \
       -v /home/me/my-project/migrations:/hasura-migrations \
       -v /home/me/my-project/metadata:/hasura-metadata \
       -e HASURA_GRAPHQL_METADATA_DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:@postgres:5432/postgres \
       hasura/graphql-engine:<version>.cli-migrations-v3
```

## Applying only Metadata {#auto-apply-metadata}

If you're managing Migrations with a different tool and want to use this image to apply only the metadata, mount the
`metadata` directory of your Hasura Project at the `/hasura-metadata` path of this Docker container the containerâ€™s
entry point script will apply the Metadata before starting the server.
