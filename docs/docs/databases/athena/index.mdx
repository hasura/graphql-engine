# Amazon Athena

:::caution Athena Beta Availability

The Hasura Amazon Athena connector is currently available in `beta` for all Hasura Cloud offerings and for Hasura
Enterprise Edition customers. Once the Athena connector is generally available (GA), it will be available only for
Hasura Cloud Enterprise and Enterprise Edition customers.

:::

:::caution Athena Beta Regions

At this time, Athena access is only available on AWS Regions.

:::

## Introduction

Hasura allows connecting to an Amazon Athena service to build a GraphQL API based on the schema of the service.

:::tip Supported versions:

1.  Hasura GraphQL Engine `v2.15.0` onwards
2.  [Amazon Athena](https://aws.amazon.com/athena/)

:::

## Get Started

To try Hasura with Amazon Athena, you'll need your own new or existing Amazon Athena instance.

Here are 2 ways you can get started with Hasura and Amazon Athena:

1.  [Hasura Cloud](/databases/athena/getting-started/cloud.mdx): You'll need to be able to access your Amazon Athena
    instance service from Hasura Cloud.
2.  [Docker](/databases/athena/getting-started/docker.mdx): Run Hasura with Docker and then connect your Amazon Athena
    instance to Hasura.

## Supported features

:::info Note

Currently, Hasura supports read-only queries, relationships, and permissions on Amazon Athena.

:::

## Managing data with the Hasura Console

The Hasura Console is a web UI that allows you to manage your data and metadata. It is available at
`http://localhost:8080/console` when you run Hasura locally, or from your project's Console endpoint when you use
[Hasura Cloud](https://cloud.hasura.io).

The data-management features (such as creating tables) are available in the `Data` tab. You can access your GraphQL API
in the `API` tab and interact with it using the GraphiQL interface.

:::info Console support

We recommend using your preferred Amazon Athena client instead. The Hasura Console is designed to be a tool for managing
your GraphQL API, and not a full-fledged database management tool.
