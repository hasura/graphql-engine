{- Note [The 'Both kind]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As described in the Haddock comments for Kind and <:, we use Kind to index
various types, such as Type and Parser. We use this to enforce various
correctness constraints mandated by the GraphQL spec; for example, we don’t
allow input object fields to have output types and we don’t allow output object
fields to have input types.

But scalars and enums can be used as input types *or* output types. A natural
encoding of that in Haskell would be to make constructors for those types
polymorphic, like this:

    data Kind = Input | Output

    data TypeInfo k where
      TIScalar      :: TypeInfo k           -- \ Polymorphic!
      TIEnum        :: ... -> TypeInfo k    -- /
      TIInputObject :: ... -> TypeInfo 'Input
      TIObject      :: ... -> TypeInfo 'Output

Naturally, this would give the `scalar` parser constructor a similarly
polymorphic type:

    scalar
      :: MonadParse m
      => Name
      -> Maybe Description
      -> ScalarRepresentation a
      -> Parser k m a             -- Polymorphic!

But if we actually try that, we run into problems. The trouble is that we want
to use the Kind to influence several different things:

  * As mentioned above, we use it to ensure that the types we generate are
    well-kinded according to the GraphQL spec rules.

  * We use it to determine what a Parser consumes as input. Parsers for input
    types parse GraphQL input values, but Parsers for output types parse
    selection sets. (See Note [The meaning of Parser 'Output] in
    Hasura.GraphQL.Parser.Internal.Parser for an explanation of why.)

  * We use it to know when to expect a sub-selection set for a field of an
    output object (see Note [The delicate balance of GraphQL kinds]).

These many uses of Kind cause some trouble for a polymorphic representation. For
example, consider our `scalar` parser constructor above---if we were to
instantiate it at kind 'Output, we’d receive a `Parser 'Output`, which we would
then expect to be able to apply to a selection set. But that doesn’t make any
sense, since scalar fields don’t have selection sets!

Another issue with this representation has to do with effectful parser
constructors (such as constructors that can throw errors). These have types like

    mkFooParser :: MonadSchema n m => Blah -> m (Parser k n Foo)

where the parser construction is itself monadic. This causes some annoyance,
since even if mkFooParser returns a Parser of a polymorphic kind, code like this
will not typecheck:

    (fooParser :: forall k. Parser k n Foo) <- mkFooParser blah

The issue is that we have to instantiate k to a particular type to be able to
call mkFooParser. If we want to use the result at both kinds, we’d have to call
mkFooParser twice:

    (fooInputParser :: Parser 'Input n Foo) <- mkFooParser blah
    (fooOutputParser :: Parser 'Output n Foo) <- mkFooParser blah

Other situations encounter similar difficulties, and they are not easy to
resolve without impredicative polymorphism (which GHC does not support).

To avoid this problem, we don’t use polymorphic kinds, but instead introduce a
form of kind subsumption. Types that can be used as both input and output types
are explicitly given the kind 'Both. This allows us to get the best of both
worlds:

  * We use the <: typeclass to accept 'Both in most places where we expect
    either input or output types.

  * We can treat 'Both specially to avoid requiring `scalar` to supply a
    selection set parser (see Note [The delicate balance of GraphQL kinds] for
    further explanation).

  * Because we avoid the polymorphism, we don’t run into the aforementioned
    issue with monadic parser constructors.

All of this is subtle and somewhat complicated, but unfortunately there isn’t
much of a way around that: GraphQL is subtle and complicated. Our use of an
explicit 'Both kind isn’t the only way to encode these things, but it’s the
particular set of compromises we’ve chosen to accept.

Note [The delicate balance of GraphQL kinds]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As discussed in Note [The 'Both kind], we use GraphQL kinds to distinguish
several different things. One of them is which output types take sub-selection
sets. For example, scalars don’t accept sub-selection sets, so if we have a
schema like

    type Query {
      users: [User!]!
    }

    type User {
      id: Int!
    }

then the following query is illegal:

    query {
      users {
        id {
          blah
        }
      }
    }

The id field has a scalar type, so it should not take a sub-selection set. This
is actually something we care about distinguishing at the type level, because it
affects the type of the `selection` parser combinator. Suppose we have a
`Parser 'Output m UserQuery` for the User type. When we parse a field with that
type, we expect to receive a UserQuery as a result, unsurprisingly. But what if
we parse an output field using the `int` parser, which has this type:

    int :: MonadParse m => Parser 'Both m Int32

If we follow the same logic as for the User parser above, we’d expect to receive
an Int32 as a result... but that doesn’t make any sense, since the Int32
corresponds to the result *we* are suppose to produce as a result of executing
the query, not something user-specified.

One way to solve this would be to associate every Parser with two result types:
one when given an input object, and one when given a selection set. Then our
parsers could be given these types, instead:

    user :: MonadParse m => Parser 'Output m Void UserQuery
    int :: MonadParse m => Parser 'Both m Int32 ()

But if you work through this, you’ll find that *all* parsers will either have
Void or () for at least one of their input result types or their output result
types, depending on their kind:

  * All 'Input parsers must have Void for their output result type, since they
    aren’t allowed to be used in output contexts at all.

  * All 'Output parsers must have Void for their input result type, since they
    aren’t allowed to be used in input contexts at all.

  * That just leaves 'Both. The only types of kind 'Both are scalars and enums,
    neither of which accept a sub-selection set. Their output result type would
    therefore be (), since they are allowed to appear in output contexts, but
    they don’t return any results.

The end result of this is that we clutter all our types with Voids and ()s, with
little actual benefit.

If you really think about it, the fact that the no types of kind 'Both accept a
sub-selection set is really something of a coincidence. In theory, one could
imagine a future version of the GraphQL spec adding a type that can be used as
both an input type or an output type, but accepts a sub-selection set. If that
ever happens, we’ll have to tweak our encoding, but for now, we can take
advantage of this happy coincidence and make the kinds serve double duty:

  * We can make `ParserInput 'Both` identical to `ParserInput 'Input`, since
    all parsers of kind 'Both only parse input values.

  * We can require types of kind 'Both in `selection`, which does not expect a
    sub-selection set, and types of kind 'Output in `subselection`, which does.

Relying on this coincidence might seem a little gross, and perhaps it is
somewhat. But it’s enormously convenient: not doing this would make some types
significantly more complicated, since we would have to thread around more
information at the type level and we couldn’t make as many simplifying
assumptions. So until GraphQL adds a type that violates these assumptions, we
are happy to take advantage of this coincidence. -}

{- Note [The interfaces story]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
GraphQL interfaces are not conceptually complicated, but they pose some
non-obvious challenges for our implementation. First, familiarize yourself with
GraphQL interfaces themselves:

  * https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#interfaces
  * http://spec.graphql.org/June2018/#sec-Interfaces
  * http://spec.graphql.org/June2018/#sec-Objects

The most logical repesentation of object and interface types is to have objects
reference the interfaces they implement, but not the other way around. After
all, that’s how it works in the GraphQL language: when you declare an interface,
you just specify its fields, and you specify which interfaces each object type
implements as part of their declarations.

However, this representation is actually not very useful for us. We /also/ need
the interfaces to reference the objects that implement them---forming a circular
structure---for two reasons:

  1. Most directly, we need this information for introspection queries.
     Introspection queries for object types return the set of interfaces they
     implement <http://spec.graphql.org/June2018/#sec-Object>, and introspection
     queries for interfaces return the set of object types that implement them
     <http://spec.graphql.org/June2018/#sec-Interface>.

  2. Less obviously, it’s more natural to specify the relationships “backwards”
     like this when building the schema using the parser combinator language.

     From the parser’s point of view, each implementation of an interface
     corresponds to a distinct parsing possibility. For example, when we
     generate a Relay schema, the type of the `node` root field is an interface,
     and each table is a type that implements it:

         type query_root {
           node(id: ID!): Node
           ...
         }

         interface Node {
           id: ID!
         }

         type author implements Node {
           id: ID!
           name: String!
           ...
         }

         type article implements Node {
           id: ID!
           title: String!
           body: String!
           ...
         }

     A query will use fragments on the Node type to access table-specific fields:

         query get_article_info($article_id: ID!) {
           node(id: $article_id) {
             ... on article {
               title
               body
             }
           }
         }

     The query parser needs to know which types implement the interface (and
     how to parse their selection sets) so that it can parse the fragments.

This presents some complications, since we need to build this information in a
circular fashion. Currently, we do this in a very naïve way:

  * We require selectionSetObject to specify the interfaces it implements /and/
    require selectionSetInterface to specify the objects that implement it.

  * We take advantage of our existing memoization mechanism to do the knot-tying
    for us (see Note [Tying the knot] in Hasura.GraphQL.Parser.Class).

You may notice that this makes it possible for the definitions to be
inconsistent: we could construct an interface parser that parses some object
type, but forget to specify that the object type implements the interface. This
inconsistency is currently completely unchecked, which is quite unfortunate. It
also means we don’t support remote schema-defined object types that implement
interfaces we generate, since we don’t know anything about those types when we
construct the interface.

Since we don’t make very much use of interface types at the time of this
writing, this isn’t much of a problem in practice. But if that changes, it would
be worth implementing a more sophisticated solution that can gather up all the
different sources of information and make sure they’re consistent. -}

{- Note [Parsing variable values]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
GraphQL includes its own tiny language for input values, which is similar to
JSON but not quite the same---GraphQL input values can be enum values, and there
are restrictions on the names of input object keys. Despite these differences,
variables’ values are passed as JSON, so we actually need to be able to parse
values expressed in both languages.

It’s tempting to contain this complexity by simply converting the JSON values to
GraphQL input values up front, and for booleans, numbers, arrays, and most
objects, this conversion is viable. But JSON strings pose a problem, since they
are used to represent both GraphQL strings and GraphQL enums. For example,
consider a query like this:

    enum FooBar {
      FOO
      BAR
    }

    query some_query($a: String, $b: FooBar) {
      ...
    }

We might receive an accompany variables payload like this:

    {
      "a": "FOO",
      "b": "FOO"
    }

To properly convert these JSON values to GraphQL, we’d need to use the type
information to guide the parsing. Since $a has type String, its value should be
parsed as the GraphQL string "FOO", while $b has type FooBar, so its value
should be parsed as the GraphQL enum value FOO.

We could do this type-directed parsing, but there are some advantages to being
lazier. For one, we can use JSON values directly when used as a column value of
type json or jsonb, rather than converting them to GraphQL and back; which, in
turn, solves another problem with JSON objects: JSON object keys are arbitrary
strings, while GraphQL input object keys are GraphQL names, and therefore
restricted: not all JSON objects can be represented by a GraphQL input object.

Arguably such columns should really be represented as strings containing encoded
JSON, not GraphQL lists/objects, but the decision to treat them otherwise is
old, and it would be backwards-incompatible to change now. We can also avoid
needing to interpret the values of variables for types outside our control
(i.e. those from a remote schema), which can be useful in the case of custom
scalars or extensions of the GraphQL protocol.

So instead we use the InputValue type to represent that an input value might be
a GraphQL literal value or a JSON value from the variables payload. This means
each input parser constructor needs to be able to parse both GraphQL values and
JSON values, but fortunately, the duplication of logic is minimal. -}

Note [Collecting types from the GraphQL schema]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A `Parser` object consists of two things:

- a function that is used to process (part of) an incoming query, and
- a piece of GraphQL type information.

The main reason that the GraphQL type information is included is so that we can
generate responses for the introspection fields `__type` and `__schema`.  In
particular, this requires us to have a complete list of all types being used in
our schema.

When we build our schema, we therefore finish by making a full walk over the
entirety of the schema, collecting the GraphQL types encountered in a `HashMap`,
allowing us to look up GraphQL types by name.  At this point we might figure out
that a single name is used to represent two GraphQL types that are materially
distinct.  For instance, the name `author` might be used as both a GraphQL
object, representing a database table, and as a scalar, e.g. as a string name.
It also prevents us from having both

```
type author {
  id : int
  name : string
}
```

and

```
type author {
  id : int
  name : string
  email : string
}
```

in the schema, as the latter has an additional field and is thus distinct from
the former, even though it has the same name.

In fact, for HGE internally, such name clashes are not problematic.  We would
merely end up exposing illegal introspection results.  But in order to produce
introspection results, we have to explore the GraphQL schema anyway, to collect
all types.  We use this opportunity to help our users figure out whether there
are any name clashes, and if so what caused them.  So we do some work to track
where in the schema various GraphQL type names were encountered.  This type
collision information is stored in `ConflictingDefinitions`.

A typical way in which conflicting type definitions occur in practice is if one
version of HGE adds a different version of HGE as a remote schema, particularly
when support for database features was added in the meantime.  For instance, if
we'd add a new operator to boolean expressions, e.g. `XOR`, then this would end
up adding an additional field to every `<column>_bool_exp` object in our schema,
which clashes with the old `<column>_bool_exp` that's part of the remote schema.
This is not a bug of the "conflicting type definitions" logic but a limitation
of the design of HGE, which would be resolved by e.g. having namespaces for
different data sources.

{- PERFORMANCE NOTE/TODO:

Since Definition's are cyclic I spent a little time trying to optimize the
== in accumulateTypeDefinitions into a nearly-noop using pointer
equality, but could not get it to trigger unless I called it on the unlifted
ByteArray# within dName, but at that point what was a pretty small theoretical
benefit disappeared for whatever reason (plus wasn't strictly safe at that
point). (Note, to have any luck calling on Definitions directly we would need
to fix the reallocation of Definitions via @fmap TI...@ in
accumulateTypeDefinitions as well)

The TODO-flavored thing here is to investigate whether we might not have as
much sharing here as we assume. We can use ghc-debug to inspect the object in
the heap.

We might also then rewrite accumulateTypeDefinitions to return non-cyclic type
definition segmants corresponding to the equality logic here (see "dodgy"
equality comments), and even consider trying to do some kind of global
interning of these across roles (though I think that would only be an
very incremental improvement...)
