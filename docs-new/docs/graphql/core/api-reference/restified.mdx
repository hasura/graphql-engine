# RESTified GraphQL Endpoints API Reference

## Introduction

The RESTified GraphQL API allows for the use of a REST interface to
saved GraphQL queries and mutations.

Users specify the query or mutation they wish to make available, as well
a URL template. Segments of the URL template can potentially capture
data to be used as GraphQL variables.

See [Metadata API Reference: RESTified GraphQL Endpoints](/graphql/core/api-reference/metadata-api/restified-endpoints.mdx) for information on how to work
with endpoints through the metadata apis.

:::tip Supported from

RESTified endpoints are supported from versions `v2.0.0-alpha.1` and
above.

:::

## Endpoint

Requests are made to `/api/rest/**` endpoints.

By default these are:

-   `GET`, `POST` requests for queries, and
-   `POST` requests for mutations

Although not in the REST spirit, `POST` requests are allowed by default
for non-mutation queries since some HTTP clients may not be able to
supply a JSON body for GET requests.

If required, users may explicitly configure the HTTP methods allowed per
endpoint.

## API Spec

### Request

Endpoints are determined by the URL templates:

-   Simple URLs such as `/s1/s2/s3` match literally.
-   Segments starting with a `:` treat these parts of the path like
    wildcards and use the name to assign a variable. For example:
    `/s1/:id/s3`.

The request expects a normal REST style request to the endpoint.

Variables can be supplied via route patterns, url query variables, and
request body JSON object keys.

-   JSON Body Object values are passed directly to the associated query
    with no additional validation or type-coersion.
-   Route variables and Query parameters are interpreted as scalars
    according to the variables types in the associated query and passed
    as JSON data through the query variables:
    -   Missing nullable variables are interpreted as `NULL`
    -   Boolean variables are interpreted as `Boolean`
    -   Boolean flags without values e.g. `/api/rest/myquery?mybool` are
        interpreted as `true`
    -   String variables are interpreted as `String`
    -   UUID variables are interpreted as `String`
    -   ID variables are interpreted as `String`
    -   Number, Int, Float, and Double variables are interpreted as
        `Number`
    -   **All other types or mismatches currently report variable type
        errors**

When making a request to this API only one endpoint should match. If
multiple endpoints match your request this is considered an error and
will report so via a 500 status code. If endpoints exist with your path,
but none matching your HTTP method then a 405 error will be returned
listing the methods that you can use.

#### Sample requests

```http
GET /api/rest/simple_query/1 HTTP/1.1
```

```http
POST /api/rest/complicated_mutation/2?time=now HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{
     "user": {"name": "Simon"}
}
```

### Response

The response is determined by the saved query. The response will be the
same as if you had made the query directly in the GraphQL console.

See the [GraphQL API Reference](/graphql/core/api-reference/graphql-api/index.mdx) for more details.

## OpenAPI 3 Specification

The OpenAPI 3 specification of the REST endpoints are exposed at
`/api/swagger/json` for admin role only:

```http
GET /api/swagger/json HTTP/1.1
X-Hasura-Role: admin
```

The response JSON will be a OpenAPI 3 specification (OAS 3.0) for all
the RESTified GraphQL Endpoints for admin roles. For more details about
OAS 3.0, [click here](https://swagger.io/specification/).

```http
GET /api/swagger/json HTTP/1.1
X-Hasura-Role: admin
