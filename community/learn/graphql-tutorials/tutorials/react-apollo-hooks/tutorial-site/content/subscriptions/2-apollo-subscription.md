The easiest way to bring live data to your UI is using the useSubscription React hook from Apollo React-Hooks. This lets you render the stream of data from your service directly within your render function of your component! One thing to note, subscriptions are just listeners, they donâ€™t request any data when first connected, but only open up a connection to get new data.
