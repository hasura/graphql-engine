## Introduction

Hasura enables you to connect to MySQL databases to automatically build a rich GraphQL API based on your database
schema.

At present, our MySQL integration is available for testing in Hasura Cloud and Docker environments, where you can run
Hasura GraphQL Engine and connect the MySQL GraphQL Data Connector to it. For more information on GraphQL Data
Connectors check out [our blog post on the topic](https://hasura.io/blog/hasura-graphql-data-connectors/).

To get started with MySQL, check out our [Getting Started with Docker](/databases/mysql/docker.mdx) guide.

:::tip Supported versions:

1.  Hasura GraphQL Engine `v2.19.0` onwards
2.  MySQL version 8.0 and higher
3.  Currently only standard implementations of MySQL are supported. PlanetScale and certain other providers are
    unsupported.

:::

:::tip Supported features

Hasura currently supports queries, mutations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE), table relationships, remote relationships and permissions on MySQL.

Note that Hasura doesn't yet support the ability to modify the database schema for MySQL, so the database you connect to
should already contain tables and data. You should also ideally have access to it outside of Hasura to modify the
schema.

:::

:::warning Deprecation Notice

The previous [MySQL preview implementation](/databases/mysql/deprecated/index.mdx) has been deprecated in favor of this
new implementation built using our [GraphQL Data Connectors](https://hasura.io/blog/hasura-graphql-data-connectors/).
