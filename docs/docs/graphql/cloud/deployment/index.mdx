# Hasura Cloud Preview Apps

Hasura Cloud enables creating Preview Apps from a branch on GitHub on each. This allows you to spin up a Hasura
Cloud Preview App on each pull request in order to automatically preview changes.

This can be achieved using either of the following:

- [Preview App GitHub Action](/graphql/cloud/deployment/preview-apps-github-action.mdx)
- [Preview App APIs](/graphql/cloud/deployment/preview-apps-api.mdx)

:::info Note

This feature is currently in beta. Please reach out through our support channels with any questions or concerns.

:::info Usage Limit

For users with only `Free` tier projects on Hasura Cloud, usage of the Preview App API is limited to 60 calls per
month. More plans are coming soon.
