# Connecting Hasura to an MS SQL on Azure Database

## Introduction

This guide explains how to connect a new or existing
[MS SQL database on Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/azure-sql/database/) to a Hasura instance, either
on [Hasura Cloud](https://cloud.hasura.io?skip_onboarding=true) or via one of our
[self-hosted](/deployment/deployment-guides/index.mdx) solutions. If you're exploring MS SQL on Azure, and are
interested in migrating an existing MS SQL database, check out their
[docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dms/tutorial-sql-server-to-azure-sql) before continuing below.

:::info Note

If you plan on using Hasura Cloud, which we recommend, follow steps 1 and 2 below. If you're self-hosting a Hasura
instance and already have a project running, skip to [step 3](#create-pg-db-mssql).

:::

## Step 1: Sign up or log in to Hasura Cloud

Navigate to [Hasura Cloud](https://cloud.hasura.io/signup/?pg=docs&plcmt=body&cta=navigate-to-hasura-cloud&tech=default)
and sign up or log in.

## Step 2: Create a Hasura Cloud project {#create-hasura-project-mssql-azure}

On the Hasura Cloud dashboard, create a new project:

<Thumbnail src="/img/cloud-dbs/create-hasura-cloud-project.png" alt="Create Hasura Cloud project" width="1000px" />

After the project is initialized successfully, click on `Launch Console` to open the Hasura Console in your browser.

On the Hasura Console, navigate to `Data -> Manage -> Connect Database -> Connect existing database`:

You will get prompted for a MS SQL Database URL. We will create this in the next step and then come back here.

<Thumbnail src="/img/cloud-dbs/mssql/existing-mssql-setup.png" alt="Hasura Cloud database setup" width="1000px" />

## Step 3: Create an MS SQL Instance on Azure {#create-pg-db-mssql}

Log into the [Azure Console](https://portal.azure.com/#home).

On the top, click on `Search` and type "SQL Server" into the search field. Then click on `SQL Servers`:

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/cloud-dbs/mssql/select-sql-server-step-1.png"
  alt="Navigate to SQL Servers on Azure"
  width="1000px"
/>

Click on the `Create` button:

<Thumbnail src="/img/cloud-dbs/mssql/click-on-create-step-2.png" alt="Create database in Azure" width="1000px" />

Select the current `Subscription` (Billing Account) and the resource group. Fill in all the necessary fields. In the
Authentication part, select `Use SQL Authentication` and fill the username and password for the SQL user.

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/cloud-dbs/mssql/fill-required-fields-step-3.png"
  alt="Fill all required fields to create database"
  width="1000px"
/>

Change additional settings or add tags to the instance if required. Once you reach to `Review + Create` tab, review all
the fields. You can go back and change any field if required. Then, click on `Create` to start deploying the server
instance.

  width="1000px"
/>

## Step 4: Allow connections to your DB from Hasura

Once Azure provisions the server, navigate to the server instance page and click on `Show networking settings`.

<Thumbnail src="/img/cloud-dbs/mssql/server-created-go-to-network.png" alt="Go to networking settings" width="1000px" />

If using Hasura Cloud, from your project's dashboard, copy the Hasura Cloud IP address:

<Thumbnail src="/img/projects/hasura-cloud-ip.png" alt="Hasura Cloud IP field" width="1000px" />

:::info Note

If you're using a self-hosted solution, you'll need to determine the IP address manually depending on your hosting
service.

:::

On Azure, under `Firewall rules` in networking settings, click on `Add a firewall rule`. Name the firewall rule and
paste the Hasura instance's IP address on both the `Start IP` and `End IP` input boxes:

<Thumbnail src="/img/cloud-dbs/mssql/add-ip-and-save.png" alt="Add IP to firewall" width="1000px" />

After entering the IP of your Hasura instance, click on `OK` and then click on `Save` at end of the page for the changes
to take effect.

## Step 5: Create database {#create-db-on-mssql-instance}

Go to the SQL Server instance's home and click on `Create Database`

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/cloud-dbs/mssql/click-on-create-db-step-6.png"
  alt="Create Database on SQL Server"
  width="1000px"
/>

Fill in all the required fields and additional settings if required. Click on `Review + create` and create the database.

<Thumbnail src="/img/cloud-dbs/mssql/create-db-step-7.png" alt="Review and create database" width="1000px" />

## Step 6: Construct the database connection URL {#construct-db-url-mssql}

The structure of the database connection URL looks as follows:

```text
Driver={ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server};Server=myServerAddress;Database=myDataBase;UID=myUsername;PWD=myPassword;
```

We recommend copying and pasting this string into the Hasura Console's `Database URL` field (in the next step) to serve
as a template. Using the information below, you can modify the attributes to meet your databases's values.

Copy the server name from instance home.

<Thumbnail src="/img/cloud-dbs/mssql/copy-server-name.png" alt="Copy server name" width="1000px" />

- `Driver`: Driver to use for connection to the SQL Server. If you are not sure, use `ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server`.
- `Server`: The server name copied from the instance page.
- `Database`: Database name created in [step 5](#create-db-on-mssql-instance).
- `UID`: Username for the SQL User created in [step 3](#create-mssql-server-instance).
- `PWD`: Password for the SQL User created in [step 3](#create-mssql-server-instance).

## Step 6: Finish connecting the database

Back on the Hasura Console, enter and modify the connection string that we referenced in
[step 6](#construct-db-url-mssql):

<Thumbnail src="/img/cloud-dbs/mssql/connect-to-hasura-step-8.png" alt="Database setup" width="1000px" />

Then click `Connect Database`.

:::info Note

For security reasons, it is recommended to set database URLs as [env vars](/hasura-cloud/projects/env-vars.mdx) and
using the env vars to connect to the databases in place of the raw database URLs.

:::

Voil√†. You are ready to start developing.

## Next steps

- You can check out our [30-Minute Hasura Basics Course](https://hasura.io/learn/graphql/hasura/introduction/) and other
  [GraphQL & Hasura Courses](https://hasura.io/learn/) for a more detailed introduction to Hasura.

- If using Hasura Cloud, you can also click the gear icon to manage your Hasura Cloud project. (e.g. add
  [collaborators](/hasura-cloud/projects/collaborators.mdx), [env vars](/hasura-cloud/projects/env-vars.mdx) or
  [custom domains](/hasura-cloud/projects/domains.mdx)).
