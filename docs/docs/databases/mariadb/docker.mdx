## Introduction

This guide will help you get set up with the [Enterprise Edition](/enterprise/overview.mdx) of Hasura GraphQL Engine
with our MariaDB integration using Docker Compose. This is the easiest way to set up Hasura Enterprise Edition and the
MariaDB GraphQL Data Connector.

:::tip Supported versions:

1.  Hasura GraphQL Engine `v2.23.0` onwards
2.  MariaDB version 10.5 and higher

:::

:::tip Alpha version supported features

Hasura currently supports queries, mutations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE), table relationships, remote relationships and permissions on MariaDB.

Note that Hasura doesn't yet support the ability to modify the database schema for MariaDB, so the database you
connect to should already contain tables and data. You should also ideally have access to it outside of Hasura to
modify the schema.

:::

## Deploying Hasura Enterprise with Docker

### Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes that the following prerequisites have been met:

- To deploy Hasura Enterprise Edition, you will need a license key. Please [contact Hasura Sales](mailto:sales@hasura.io) if you do not
  already have one.
- You have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
  working on your machine.
- You have access to a MariaDB database for which you would like to create an API.

### Step 1: Get the Docker Compose file

The [install manifests repo](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/tree/master/install-manifests) contains all
installation manifests required to deploy Hasura anywhere. The Docker Compose manifest also contains a Postgres database
in order to store the Hasura metadata and a Redis instance for caching.

```bash
# in a new directory run
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hasura/graphql-engine/master/install-manifests/enterprise/mariadb/docker-compose.yaml
# or run
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hasura/graphql-engine/master/install-manifests/enterprise/mariadb/docker-compose.yaml -o docker-compose.yaml
```

### Step 2: Set the Hasura Enterprise Edition license key and the admin secret

Edit the downloaded `docker-compose.yaml` and set the license key and admin secret.

An [admin secret key](/deployment/securing-graphql-endpoint.mdx) is required to make sure that your GraphQL endpoint and
the Hasura Console are not publicly accessible.

#### Edit the Docker Compose file to include the license key and admin secret environment variables

```yaml {5-6}

---
graphql-engine:
  image: hasura/graphql-engine:v2.12.0
  environment:
    HASURA_GRAPHQL_EE_LICENSE_KEY: <license key>
    HASURA_GRAPHQL_ADMIN_SECRET: <your secretkey>
```

:::caution Secure the admin secret

The `HASURA_GRAPHQL_ADMIN_SECRET` should never be passed from the client to the Hasura GraphQL Engine as it would give
the client full admin rights to your Hasura instance. See [Authentication & Authorization](/auth/overview.mdx) for
information on setting up auth in Hasura.

:::

### Step 3: Run Hasura GraphQL Engine

The following command will create and run the containers in the Docker Compose manifest:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Check that the containers are running:

```bash
docker ps

CONTAINER ID IMAGE                              ... CREATED STATUS PORTS          ...
097f58433a2b hasura/graphql-engine              ... 1m ago  Up 1m  8080->8080/tcp ...
b0b1aac0508d postgres                           ... 1m ago  Up 1m  5432/tcp ...
3a29aa348999 redis:7                            ... 1m ago  Up 1m  6379/tcp ...
7b5b2ee70ece hasura/graphql-data-connector      ... 1m ago  Up 1m  5005/tcp ..
```

### Step 4: Load the Hasura Console

Open the Hasura Console by navigating to `http://localhost:8080/console`. You will need to input your admin secret key
as set in your Docker Compose file to log in.

### Step 5: Connect to a MariaDB database

From the Console, click the `Data` tab:

<Thumbnail src="/img/getting-started/connect-db-console.png" alt="Connect database" width="1000px" />

Select the MariaDB (Alpha) data source driver, enter in a display name for the database and set the JDBC Connection URL
for your MariaDB instance.

The JDBC connection URL should look like this:

```yaml {4-6}
jdbc:mariadb://<hostname>:<port>/<database name>?user=<username>&password=<password>
```

For example:

```yaml {4-6}
jdbc:mariadb://myhost.mycompany.com/mariadb?user=abc&password=pqr  # assuming the default port 3306
jdbc:mariadb://localhost:4533/mariadb?user=abc&password=pqr        # assuming MariaDB is running on port 4533
```

For more information see
[MariaDB Connection URL syntax](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/about-mariadb-connector-j/#using-the-driver).

Click `Connect Database`.

### Step 6: Track tables and run GraphQL API queries

Now that you have successfully connected your MariaDB database to Hasura, you can track tables and use Hasura to
automatically build a full-featured GraphQL API for it.

### Step 7 (optional): Use managed PostgreSQL and Redis instances

The Hasura Enterprise Edition Docker compose files come with containerized open-source versions of PostgreSQL and Redis.

We highly recommend using managed PostgreSQL and Redis instances especially when running in production.

To switch to using your PostgreSQL or Redis instances, set the following environment variables:

```yaml {4-6}
HASURA_GRAPHQL_METADATA_DATABASE_URL HASURA_GRAPHQL_REDIS_URL HASURA_GRAPHQL_RATE_LIMIT_REDIS_URL
```

For example:

```yaml {5-7}

---
graphql-engine:
  image: hasura/graphql-engine:v2.12.0
  environment:
    HASURA_GRAPHQL_METADATA_DATABASE_URL: postgres://postgres:postgrespassword@postgres:5432/postgres
    HASURA_GRAPHQL_REDIS_URL: 'redis://redis:6379'
    HASURA_GRAPHQL_RATE_LIMIT_REDIS_URL: 'redis://redis:6379'
```
