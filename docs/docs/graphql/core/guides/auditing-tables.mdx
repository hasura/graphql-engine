# Auditing actions on tables in Postgres

Typically audit logging is added to some of the tables to comply with
various certifications. You may want to capture the user information
(role and the session variables) for every change in Postgres that is
done through the GraphQL engine.

For every mutation, Hasura roughly executes the following transaction:

```sql
BEGIN;
SET local "hasura.user" = '{"x-hasura-role": "role", ... various session variables}'
SQL related to the mutation
COMMIT;
```

This information can therefore be captured in any trigger on the
underlying tables by using the `current_setting` function as follows:

```sql
current_setting('hasura.user');
```

We've set up some utility functions that'll let you quickly get started
with auditing in this [repo](https://github.com/hasura/audit-trigger).
