# Quickstart with Docker

<div className='badge badge--primary heading-badge'>Available on: Enterprise Edition</div>

## Introduction

This guide will help you get the Enterprise Edition of Hasura GraphQL Engine, a Postgres database to store its metadata,
and a Redis database running as Docker containers using Docker Compose. This is the easiest way to set up Hasura
Enterprise Edition on your **local environment**.

**This guide requires HGE versions `v2.12.0-beta.1` and above.** Installation instructions are below.

## Deploying Hasura EE using Docker

### Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes that the following prerequisites have been met:

- You have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
  working on your machine.

### Step 1: Get the docker-compose file

The [install manifests repo](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/tree/master/install-manifests) contains all
installation manifests required to deploy Hasura anywhere. Get the docker compose file from there:

```bash
# in a new directory run
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hasura/graphql-engine/stable/install-manifests/enterprise/docker-compose/docker-compose.yaml
# or run
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hasura/graphql-engine/stable/install-manifests/enterprise/docker-compose/docker-compose.yaml -o docker-compose.yml
```

### Step 2: Set the Hasura EE license key and the admin secret

Edit the downloaded `docker-compose.yml` and set the license key and admin secret:

To make sure that your GraphQL endpoint and the Hasura console are not publicly accessible, you need to configure an
admin secret key.

#### Run the Docker container with the license key and admin secret env var

```yaml {4-5}
graphql-engine:
  image: hasura/graphql-engine:v2.12.0
  environment:
    HASURA_GRAPHQL_EE_LICENSE_KEY: ""
    HASURA_GRAPHQL_ADMIN_SECRET: myadminsecretkey
  ...
```

:::info Note

The `HASURA_GRAPHQL_ADMIN_SECRET` should never be passed from the client to the Hasura GraphQL engine as it would give
the client full admin rights to your Hasura instance. See [Authentication & Authorization](/auth/index.mdx) for
information on setting up authentication.

:::

### Step 3: Run Hasura GraphQL engine

The following command will run Hasura GraphQL engine along with a Postgres database to store its metadata.

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Check if the containers are running:

```bash
docker ps

CONTAINER ID IMAGE                 ... CREATED STATUS PORTS          ...
097f58433a2b hasura/graphql-engine ... 1m ago  Up 1m  8080->8080/tcp ...
b0b1aac0508d postgres              ... 1m ago  Up 1m  5432/tcp       ...
```

### Step 4 (optional): Use your PostgreSQL and Redis instances

The Hasura EE Docker compose files come with containerized open-source versions of PostgreSQL and Redis. Note that these
are not managed by Hasura.

We highly recommend using managed PostgreSQL and Redis instances in production.

To switch to using your PostgreSQL or Redis instances, set the following environment variables:

```yaml {4-6}
graphql-engine:
  image: hasura/graphql-engine:v2.12.0
  environment:
    HASURA_GRAPHQL_METADATA_DATABASE_URL: postgres://postgres:postgrespassword@postgres:5432/postgres
    HASURA_GRAPHQL_REDIS_URL: "redis://redis:6379"
    HASURA_GRAPHQL_RATE_LIMIT_REDIS_URL: "redis://redis:6379"
  ...
```

### Step 5: Start using Hasura

Congratulations! You have successfully set up Hasura EE on Docker.

## Hasura GraphQL engine server logs {#docker-logs}

You can check the logs of the Hasura GraphQL engine deployed using Docker by checking the logs of the GraphQL engine
container:

```bash
docker ps

CONTAINER ID IMAGE                 ... CREATED STATUS PORTS          ...
097f58433a2b hasura/graphql-engine ... 1m ago  Up 1m  8080->8080/tcp ...
b0b1aac0508d postgres              ... 1m ago  Up 1m  5432/tcp       ...


docker logs 097f58433a2b

{"timestamp":"2018-10-09T11:20:32.054+0000", "level":"info", "type":"http-log", "detail":{"status":200, "query_hash":"01640c6dd131826cff44308111ed40d7fbd1cbed", "http_version":"HTTP/1.1", "query_execution_time":3.0177627e-2, "request_id":null, "url":"/v1/graphql", "user":{"x-hasura-role":"admin"}, "ip":"127.0.0.1", "response_size":209329, "method":"POST", "detail":null}}
...
```

**See:**

- [Docker logs](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging) for more details on logging in Docker.
- [Hasura GraphQL engine logs](/deployment/logging.mdx) for more details on Hasura logs.

## Updating Hasura GraphQL engine {#docker-update}

This guide will help you update the Hasura GraphQL engine running with Docker. This guide assumes that you already have
Hasura GraphQL engine running with Docker.

### Step 1: Check the latest release version

The current latest version is:

<code>
  hasura/graphql-engine:
  <LatestRelease />
</code>

All the versions can be found [here](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/releases).

### Step 2: Update the Docker image

In the `docker compose` command that you're running, update the image tag to this latest version.

For example, if you had:

```yaml
graphql-engine:
  image: hasura/graphql-engine:v2.9.0
```

you should change it to:

<pre>
  <code>
    graphql-engine:
    <br />
    {'  '}image: hasura/graphql-engine:
    <LatestRelease />
  </code>
</pre>

:::info Note

If you are downgrading to an older version of the GraphQL engine, you might need to downgrade your metadata catalogue
version as described in [Downgrading Hasura GraphQL engine](/deployment/downgrading.mdx).
