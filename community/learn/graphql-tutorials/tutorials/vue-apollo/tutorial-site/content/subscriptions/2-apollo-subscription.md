The easiest way to bring live data to your UI is using the Smart Subscription from vue-apollo. Each subscription declared in the apollo.$subscribe option in a component results in the creation of a smart subscription object.

One thing to note, subscriptions in vue-apollo are just listeners, they donâ€™t request any data when first connected, but only open up a connection to get new data. But in Hasura GraphQL Engine, subscriptions are live queries. The initial request gives back data, if any, for the subscription.
