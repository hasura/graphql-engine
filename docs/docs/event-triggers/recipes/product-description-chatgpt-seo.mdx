# Update a Product Description to Improve SEO using AI

## Introduction

Event Triggers allow you to react to changes in your database automatically and asynchronously by calling a webhook.

In this guide, we'll show how to use Event Triggers to react to a `product` insert operation created by sending a
request to the OpenAI ChatGPT API with a request to improve the product's description for SEO purposes.

In this recipe, we'll be overwriting the `description` field of the product with the improved description returned by
the ChatGPT API. In reality, you would likely not want to overwrite the field but instead, store the improved version
in another column in the database for human review.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure that you have the docs e-commerce sample app deployed to Hasura Cloud.

:::info Tunneling your webhook endpoint from your local machine

If you plan on using a webhook endpoint hosted on your own machine, ensure that you have a tunneling service such as
[ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) set up so that your Cloud Project can communicate with your local machine.

:::

## Our model

When designing a system such as this, there are at least three components to consider:

- Which table's changes will initiate the Event Trigger?
- Which operation(s) on that table will initiate the Event Trigger?
- What should my webhook do with the data it receives?

In this example, we'll be using the `products` table and the `insert` operation to trigger the Event Trigger. The
webhook will call the OpenAI ChatGPT API with a custom prompt and the description data to get an improved version of the
description. Finally, the webhook will update the `product` table with the improved description.


## Step 1: Create the Event Trigger

Go to your Hasura Console and click the `Events` tab. You should automatically be on the `Event Triggers` item in the
sidebar.

Click `Create`.

  width="1000px"
/>

## Step 2: Configure the Event Trigger

First, provide a name for your trigger, for example: `product_description_ai_seo`.

Select the database, schema, table, and table operation that you want to trigger the event. In this example, we'll use
the `default` database, the `public` schema, the `products` table and set the trigger to fire on the `Insert` operation.

  alt="Create Hasura Event Trigger"
  width="1000"
/>

Enter a webhook URL that will be called when a new product is inserted into this table. This URL will point to the
logic we're going to implement later:

```text
https://<your-webhook-url>/product-description-ai-seo
```

  alt="Create Hasura Event Trigger"
  width="500"
/>


:::info Tunneling your webhook endpoint to your local machine

You'll need to use a tunneling service such as [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to expose a webhook endpoint running on your
local machine to the internet and Hasura Cloud. This will give you a public URL that will forward requests to your local
machine and the server which we'll configure below.

You'll need to modify your webhook URL to use the public URL provided by ngrok.

After installing ngrok and
[authenticating](https://ngrok.com/docs/secure-tunnels/ngrok-agent/tunnel-authtokens/#:~:text=Once%20you've%20signed%20up,make%20installing%20the%20authtoken%20simple.),
you can do this by running:

```bash
ngrok http 4000
```

Then, copy the `Forwarding` value for use in our webhook 🎉

:::

Under `Advanced Settings`, we can configure the headers that will be sent with the request. We'll add an
`authentication` header to prevent abuse of the endpoint and ensure that only Hasura can trigger the event. Set the
`Key` as `secret-authorization-string` and the `Value` as `super_secret_string_123`.

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/scheduled-triggers/scheduled-triggers_recipes_review-request_auth-header.png"
  alt="Hasura Scheduled Trigger architecture"
  width="1000"
/>

:::tip Secrets as environment variables

For simplicity in this example we've used a string literal for the value of the authorization header. In production, you
should always use an environment variable to store secrets. This prevents your secrets from being exposed in your
codebase and will also allow you to change the value without having to update the Event Trigger.

:::

Leave [`Auto-cleanup Event Logs`](/event-triggers/clean-up/index.mdx) and
[`Configure REST Connectors`](/event-triggers/rest-connectors.mdx) as they are. In production these settings are useful
and are covered in their respective places in docs.

Finally, click the "Create Event Trigger" button to create the trigger.

## Step 3: Implement the Webhook

Your webhook can be a simple HTTP server that performs the desired tasks. It could be written in any programming
language or framework you prefer. The webhook needs to do three main things when triggered:

1. Parse the request body to get the `id` and `description` data from the `product` table `insert` operation that Hasura
   sends.
2. Call the OpenAI ChatGPT API with a custom prompt and the description data to get an improved version of the
   description.
3. Update the `product` table with the improved description.

Here's an example implementation using Node.js and Express:

<details>
  <summary>
    Let's create a script to do it:
  </summary>

  In a new directory run the following to create a new `package.json` file:

  ```bash
  npm init -y
  ```

  Install the dependencies for the server:

  ```bash
  npm install openai express
  ```

  Create an index.js file in the root of the folder and paste in the code below:

  ```javascript
  const express = require('express');
  const OpenAI = require('openai');

  // Constants for server and external service configurations
  const PORT = 4000;
  const OPEN_AI_KEY = 'YOUR-OPENAI-KEY';
  const HASURA_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT = 'YOUR-HASURA-GRAPHQL-ENDPOINT';
  const HASURA_ADMIN_SECRET = 'YOUR-HASURA-ADMIN-SECRET';

  // Set up the express server instance
  const app = express();

  // Middleware to parse incoming JSON and URL-encoded bodies
  app.use(express.json()); // to support JSON-encoded bodies
  app.use(express.urlencoded({extended: true}));

  // Initialize OpenAI client with the provided API key
  const openai = new OpenAI({
      apiKey: OPEN_AI_KEY,
  });

  /**
   * Function to improve the original product description for SEO using OpenAI.
   * @param {string} originalDescription - The original product description.
   * @return {string} The improved description for SEO.
   */
  async function improveDescription(originalDescription) {

      const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
        messages: [{
          role: 'user',
          content: `You are an SEO expert who works on an e-commerce website. Your task is to take the following product description and improve it for SEO purposes, making it more likely to rank highly in search engines and lead to increased visitor traffic and purchases. Only respond with the improved description and nothing else. If there is nothing to improve then respond with the original content. The product description to improve for SEO is as follows: ${originalDescription}`
        }],
        model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo',
      });

      return completion.choices[0].message.content;
  }

  /**
   * Function to update the product description in Hasura.
   * @param {string} productId - The unique ID of the product.
   * @param {string} improvedDescription - The improved product description.
   * @return {string} The product ID of the updated product.
   */
  async function updateProductDescription(productId, improvedDescription) {
    // Send a POST request to Hasura's GraphQL endpoint to update the product description
    const response = await fetch(HASURA_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT, {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'x-hasura-admin-secret': HASURA_ADMIN_SECRET,
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        query: `
            mutation UpdateProduct($id: uuid!, $description: String) {
              update_products_by_pk(pk_columns: {id: $id}, _set: {description: $description}) {
                id
                description
              }
            }
            `,
        variables: {
          id: productId,
          description: improvedDescription,
        },
      }),
    });

    const {data} = await response.json();
    return data.update_products_by_pk.id;
  };

  // API endpoint to improve and update product descriptions using AI
  app.post('/product-description-ai-seo', async (req, res, next) => {

    try {
      // Check for the custom authorization header for security
      const authHeader = req.headers['secret-authorization-string'];
      if (authHeader !== 'super_secret_string_123') {
        console.log('Unauthorized');
        return res.status(401).json({message: 'Unauthorized'});
      }

      // Extract description and id from the incoming request
      const {description, id} = req.body?.event?.data?.new;

      console.log(`Description: ${description}\n`);

      // Ensure both description and id are present
      if (!description || !id) {
        console.log('Bad request: no description or id\n');
        return res.status(400).json({message: 'Bad request'});
      }

      // Get the improved description from OpenAI
      const improvedDescription = await improveDescription(description);
      console.log(`Improved description: ${improvedDescription}\n`);

      // Update the product description in Hasura
      await updateProductDescription(id, improvedDescription);

      // Return a success response
      console.log('Success\n');
      return res.status(200).json({message: 'Success'});
    } catch (error) {
      // Handle any errors
      next(error); // Forward error to centralized error handling
    }
  });

  // Centralized error handling
  app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
    console.error(err.stack);
    res.status(500).json({message: 'Internal server error'});
  });

  // Start the server on the specified port
  app.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Server started on port ${PORT}\n`);
  });
```

</details>

## Step 4: Test your Setup

Now that your Event Trigger and webhook are set up, you can test it by simulating a new product being added.

Run your server with `node index.js` and go to the Hasura Console and click the `Data` tab. From there, in the left
navigation, click the `public` schema of the `default` database. Then, click the `products` table.

For this example let's create a new product by cloning an existing one so that we don't have to worry about getting
the correct ids for the foreign key relationships.

Click the clone button on the row for the "Monogram Baseball Cap" product.


<Thumbnail
  src="/img/event-triggers/recipes/product-description-seo/product-description-ai-seo_products-table-browse_2-32-0.png"
  alt="Create Hasura Event Trigger"
  width="1000"
/>


You will be presented with a form to enter the details of the new product. For `id`, `created_at` and `updated_at`
click the "default" radio button so that those fields take on their default values in the new row.

For the `name` field, enter a new name for the product, for example: "Monogram Baseball Cap 2". Then you can use
this dummy description, which has awful SEO and is ripe for improvement:

```text
Baseball Cap  This is a cap. It's a hat you can wear. It's made of some material. You can wear it on your head. It has
some design on it. It might fit you. It has a thing on the back to make it fit better. It's good for sunny days or any
days. You can wear it with clothes. It's a good cap. Buy this cap. It's a nice cap. Good cap for sale. Best cap online.
Buy cap now.  Note: This hat is a hat. Clean it sometimes. Don't lose it. It's a good hat. Buy hat
```

  alt="Create Hasura Event Trigger"
  width="1000"
/>

Click "Save" and then switch to your terminal to see the logs of the script. You should see the following:

<details>

  <summary>Click here to see an example of the console log of the webhook.</summary>

  ```
  Server started on port 4000

  Description: Baseball Cap  This is a cap. It's a hat you can wear. It's made of some material. You can wear it on your
  head. It has some design on it. It might fit you. It has a thing on the back to make it fit better. It's good for
  sunny days or any days. You can wear it with clothes. It's a good cap. Buy this cap. It's a nice cap. Good cap for
  sale. Best cap online. Buy cap now.  Note: This hat is a hat. Clean it sometimes. Don't lose it. It's a good hat. Buy
  hat.

</details>

You can confirm that everything worked by clicking back to the `products` table in the Hasura Console and viewing the
new saved description of the product.

## Conclusion

In this guide, we've shown how to use Hasura Event Triggers to automate a useful task of increasing the SEO score of
a piece of text, which is common for an e-commerce application, by using a powerful API. This can be a useful strategy
drive conversion and revenue in e-commerce applications and the idea can be adapted for a wide range of other tasks.
