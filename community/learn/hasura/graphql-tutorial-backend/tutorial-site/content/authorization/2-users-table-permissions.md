We also need to allow select and update operations into `users` table. 
On the left sidebar, click on the `users` table to navigate to the users table page and switch to the Permissions tab.

## Select permission

Click on the Edit icon (pencil icon) to modify the select permission for role user. This would open up a section below which lets you configure its permissions.

Here the users should be able to access every other user's `id` and `name` data.

Click on `Save Permissions`

## Update permission

The user who is logged in should be able to modify only his own record. So letâ€™s set that permission now. 

In the Row update permission, under custom check, choose the following condition.

```json
{"id":{"_eq":"X-Hasura-User-Id"}}
```

Under column update permissions, select `last_seen` column, as this will be updated from the frontend app.

Click on `Save Permissions` and you are done with access control rules for `users` table.
