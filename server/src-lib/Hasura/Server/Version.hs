-- | Lots of random things need access to the current version. It would be very convenient to define
-- @version :: 'Version'@ in this module and export it, and indeed, that’s what we used to do! But
-- that turns out to cause problems: the version is compiled into the executable via Template
-- Haskell, so the Pro codebase runs into awkward problems. Since the Pro codebase depends on this
-- code as a library, it has to do gymnastics to ensure that this library always gets recompiled in
-- order to use the updated version, and that’s really hacky.
--
-- A better solution is to explicitly plumb the version through to everything that needs it, but
-- that would be noisy, so as a compromise we use an implicit parameter. Since implicit parameters
-- are a little cumbersome, we hide the parameter itself behind this 'HasVersion' constraint,
-- 'currentVersion' can be used to access it, and 'withVersion' can be used to bring a version into
-- scope.
