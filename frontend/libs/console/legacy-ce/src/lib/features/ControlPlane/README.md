To generate GraphQL types, Run `yarn generate-control-plane-gql-types` from the `/frontend` directory

Note: The command uses the config file `frontend/control-plane-graphql-codegen.yml`. It uses the lux localdev endpoint and the localdev admin secret. Make sure
those reflect the current localdev environment. Please update it accordingly if needed.

## Important note

The `InputMaybe` type is not generated by the codegen tool becuase of issues in the version that we use.
For now, ensure you add this line at the top of the file whenever you regenerate the types:
Reference to the issue: https://github.com/dotansimha/graphql-code-generator/issues/7774

```typescript
export type InputMaybe<T> = Maybe<T>;
```
