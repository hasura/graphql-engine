# Postgres functions

## Introduction

[Postgres functions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createfunction.html)
allow you to customize your database schema by defining a set of
operations that can include several statements such as declarations,
assignments and conditional workflows. Postgres functions are similar to
views but allow more procedural computations and can take arguments. SQL
functions are also referred to as **stored procedures**.

:::info Note

For more information on Postgres functions, please refer to the
[Postgres documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createfunction.html).

## Examples

**Searching articles**

We can create the following function that we can call later to search
articles based on the input text argument `search`.

```plsql
CREATE FUNCTION search_articles(search text)
RETURNS SETOF article AS $$
    SELECT *
    FROM article
    WHERE
      title ilike ('%' || search || '%')
      OR content ilike ('%' || search || '%')
$$ LANGUAGE sql STABLE;
```

Let's break this function apart:

-   Function name: `search_articles`
-   Parameters: there is one parameter where `search` is the name and
    `text` is the type
-   Return type: `SETOF article`
-   Function body: Block from `SELECT` until the end of the `WHERE`
    clause
-   Language: The response is returned in the `sql` language

## Postgres functions & Hasura

Postgres functions can be exposed in Hasura's GraphQL schema as a
top-level field or as a computed field for a table. They are typically
used for performing custom business logic in the database.

Refer to [Custom SQL functions](/graphql/core/databases/postgres/schema/custom-functions.mdx) and
[Computed fields](/graphql/core/databases/postgres/schema/computed-fields.mdx) for more use cases and for
instructions on how to create and expose Postgres functions in Hasura.
