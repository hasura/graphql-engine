## Prerequisites

1. Hasura EE can be deployed as a single Docker container and so to install and use this product, you will need a
   container platform (e.g. Docker, Kubernetes, AWS ECS, Google CloudRun, Azure Containers).

   cloud or infrastructure provider.

   - **PostgreSQL database (v10 and above)** to store your Metadata (just like Hasura CE).
   - **Redis database (v5 and above)**.
