# Test Tooling

# Unit Tests

Unit tests are written using [Jest Framework](https://jestjs.io/).

- How to run tests locally: `$ npm run jest` or `$ npm run jest-watch` (for watch mode)
- Unit testing is mostly applied on the utility functions.

## E2E tests

E2E Tests are written using [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/).

- How to run tests locally: `$ npm run cy:open`
- Write your tests in the `cypress/e2e` directory.

More info are available at the [Cypress' README](./../../../../cypress/README.md).]

### Chromatic

[Chromatic](https://www.chromatic.com/) is used for visual testing the stories.
If you have a story you do not wish to snapshot in Chromatic, you can disable snapshotting with the [disableSnapshot](https://www.chromatic.com/docs/ignoring-elements#ignore-stories) story parameter.
