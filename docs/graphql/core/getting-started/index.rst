Introduction
------------

To use the Hasura GraphQL engine, you need to:

- Deploy the Hasura GraphQL engine with access to a Postgres database
- Set up and test your GraphQL API using the Hasura console UI *(also possible via the CLI or API)*
- Consume the generated GraphQL API from your client apps

Get started from scratch
------------------------

- :ref:`Using Hasura Cloud <cloud_getting_started>` **(recommended)**: Create
  a new Hasura Cloud project with just a few clicks.
- :ref:`Using Docker <docker_simple>`: Run a **local development** setup that sets up both the Hasura GraphQL
  engine and Postgres using Docker Compose.

Get started using an existing database
--------------------------------------

- :ref:`Using Hasura Cloud <cloud_getting_started>` **(recommended)**: Create a new Hasura Cloud project connected to an existing Postgres database.
- :ref:`Using Docker <deployment_docker>`: Run as a docker container and connect to an existing Postgres
  database.
- :ref:`Using Kubernetes <deploy_kubernetes>`: Run on Kubernetes and connect to an existing Postgres
  database.
