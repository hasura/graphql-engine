# HGE Docs Migration Guide

This page will act as a migration guide for the docs migration.

This page will cover all the factors that require a clarification during the migration process. If missed any, please let us know.


## How to Start the Migration?

> Used an auto transform tool [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org) to transform `reStructiredText` to `GitHub flavoured markdown` and added the resultant markdown content in respective `.txt` files.

You will be working in the `/docs-new/docs/graphql` directory. Here you can find the `.txt` files already added from auto-transform result. So, you don't have to create any new files.

Below is the steps to complete the migration cylcle for each doc file.

- Update the extension and migrate content.

1. Convert the transformed `.rst.txt` to `.mdx` extension for the file to be able to show up in sidebar and UI.

2. Use this migration guide for syntactical and usage reference.

3. Validate content and cleanup misc divs that are populated during auto transform and any invalid mdx data.

4. The misc populated divs exist to ease adding metadata and any sphinx directives that can't be auto transformed to markdown. Please cross referene the actual RST file for content validation.

- Verify content correctness (compare against the current live version of [Hasura docs](https://hasura.io/docs/)) and preview in UI.


:::tip

Please go through the [FAQs](/rst-vs-mdx-guide/faqs.mdx) section to understand the common caveats with docusaurus and their workarounds.

## Migration Guide Format

### Tabs
Most of this guide will inculde tabs for syntax migration examples wherever applicable.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="sphinx" label="Sphinx - RST" default>
    Snippets from current docs in RST syntax will be shown in this tab which needs to be migrated to mdx
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="docusaurus" label="Docusaurus - MDX">
    MDX Snippet which is migrated from RST will be added in this tab.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

<br />

### Normal Headings
Whereever Tab system is quite difficult to understand/implement. The `Sphinx - RST` and `Docusaurus - MDX` will just be normal sections with headings in respective order.

#### Sphinx - RST
Snippets from current docs in RST syntax will be shown in this tab which needs to be migrated to mdx

#### Docusaurus - MDX
MDX Snippet which is migrated from RST will be added in this tab.

:::note

Please note that all code snippets in this guide are directly taken from current docs in RST format and migrated to MDX to provide an example.
