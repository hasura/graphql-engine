How Hasura's GraphQL schema generation works
============================================

Given your Postgres database, Hasura GraphQL engine can automatically generate a GraphQL schema and process both GraphQL
queries and mutations.

How does Hasura GraphQL engine know which tables and views are in which schema and how to connect them so that they
form a graph over which queries and mutations should be allowed?

Here's what Hasura GraphQL engine does under the hood:

Tables
------

Let's say you have a table, a ``profile (id, name)`` table, in Postgres that you want to expose over GraphQL.

All you need to do is tell Hasura GraphQL engine to ``track`` this table, and Hasura GraphQL engine automatically
generates a GraphQL schema with:

#. A GraphQL type definition for the table
#. Queries with ``where``, ``order_by``, ``limit`` and ``offset`` arguments
#. Insert mutations that support bulk and upsert
#. Update mutations that support conditional bulk updates
#. Delete mutations that support conditional bulk deletes

Views
-----

If you have a view in Postgres, Hasura GraphQL engine does the same thing it would for a table, but without creating
mutations.

Relationships or Connections
----------------------------

Between one table/view and another table/view, you can tell Hasura GraphQL engine to create a relationship or a
connection between
their 2 nodes in a graph, using a particular column as a link. Often, you have foreign-key constraints that
indicate a relationship and you can tell Hasura GraphQL engine to use that foreign-key constraint to create a
relationship too.

You can specify an ``object relationship`` or an ``array relationship`` between tables and views. For example:

#. You might have a ``restaurant.average_rating`` where ``average_rating`` is a view connected to the ``restaurant``
   table via a ``restaurant_id``.
#. You might have a ``user.addresses`` where each user has multiple addresses connected via a ``user_id``.

When you create a relationship, Hasura GraphQL engine does the following:

#. Augments the types of tables/views involved by adding a reference to the nested type
#. Augments the possible ``where`` and ``order_by`` clauses that can be used to enable nested filtering and sorting

Resolvers
---------

Hasura GraphQL engine does not have any resolvers. The Hasura GraphQL engine is actually a compiler that compiles
your GraphQL query into an SQL query.
Hasura's GraphQL syntax is also optimized to expose the power of the underlying SQL so that you can make powerful
queries via GraphQL.

Metadata
--------

All the metadata required for the above is stored by Hasura GraphQL engine in specific Postgres schemas in your
database. See :doc:`Hasura GraphQL engine internals <../engine-internals/index>` for details.

..
  Hasura GraphQL engine also does a lot of work to ensure that your metadata can be kept in sync with your actual
  Postgres schema.

  #. You can run DDL queries through Hasura GraphQL engine to check if the Postgres schema change will cause some
   metadata to fail
  #. You can ask Hasura GraphQL engine to validate the current metadata it has against your Postgres schema and spit
   out invalid metadata so that you can correct them
