# https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/issues/5200

# NOTE:-
# The GraphQL schema generation refactor (https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/pull/4111) auto fixes the
# aforementioned issue, but in different way, by restricting the generation of *_by_pk root fields
# when all primary key columns are not marked for selection in permission. The actual fix
# (https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/pull/5522) is to generate the typeinfos for all primary key columns
# irrespective of select permissions. So, the test case is modified accordingly to check
# the absence of zones_by_pk query root field.
