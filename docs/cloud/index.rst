Hasura Cloud Documentation
==========================

`Hasura Cloud <https://cloud.hasura.io/>`__ offers hosted `GraphQL Engine <https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine>`__
projects with extra features for reliability and security. It includes all the `core features <https://hasura.io/docs/1.0/graphql/manual/index.html>`__
of GraphQL Engine, while taking care of infrastructure concerns, such as the number of instances, cores, memory, concurrent users, high-availability,
realtime monitoring, caching, tracing, and rate-limiting. It supports both new and existing PostgreSQL databases.
