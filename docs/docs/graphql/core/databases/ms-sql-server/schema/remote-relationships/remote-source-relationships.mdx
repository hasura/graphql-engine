# MS SQL Server: Database to remote database relationships

## Introduction

Remote database relationships (a.k.a remote source relationships) extend the
concept of joining data between tables within a single database to joining data
across tables between separate databases.

After you've established relationships between types in your source database and
types in your target database, you can "join" them with GraphQL queries.

Because Hasura is meant to be a GraphQL server that you can expose
directly to your apps, Hasura also handles security and authorization
while providing remote joins.

:::tip Supported from

Remote database relationships for MS SQL Server are supported from versions `v2.6.0` and above.

## Create remote database relationships

### Step 0: Add two database sources

Add a source database as described [here](/graphql/core/databases/connect-db.mdx) and track the required tables.
Then, repeat the process to add your target database.

### Step 1: Define and create the relationship

A remote database relationship is defined alongside the source database table (that is, the source side of the join).

The following fields can be defined for a remote schema relationship:

- **Relationship type**: Either `object` or `array` - similar to normal relationships. Hasura supports both many-to-one (object) and one-to-many (array) relationships.
- **Relationship Name**: A name for the relationship.
- **Reference Source**: The name of the target database (that is, the target side of the join).
- **Reference Table**: The table in the target database source that should be joined with the source table
- **Field Mapping**: A mapping between fields in the source table and their corresponding fields in the target table, just as a foreign key relationship would be defined by such mapping within a single database.

For example, say we have a table `order(id int, user_id int)` in the source database and a table `user(id int, name text)` in the target database.

We can create an object remote database relationship `user` joining the `order` table to the `user` table using the `order.user_id` and `user.id` fields.

Head to the `Data > [database] > [orders] > Relationships` tab.
Under the `Remote Database Relationships` section, select `Add a remote database relationship`.

Hit `Save`.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

Update the `metadata > databases > [db-name] > tables > [public_orders].yaml` file:

```yaml {4-14}
table:
  name: order
  schema: public
remote_relationships:
- name: user
  definition:
    to_source:
      relationship_type: object
      source: pg2
      table:
        name: user
        schema: public
      field_mapping:
        user_id: id
```

Apply the metadata:

```bash
hasura metadata apply
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="api" label="API">

You can add a remote database relationship by using the
[mssql_create_remote_relationship](/graphql/core/api-reference/metadata-api/remote-relationships.mdx#metadata-mssql-create-remote-relationship) or
[mssql_update_remote_relationship](/graphql/core/api-reference/metadata-api/remote-relationships.mdx#metadata-mssql-update-remote-relationship) metadata APIs with the `to_source` field.

```http
POST /v1/metadata HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
X-Hasura-Role: admin

{
  "type": "mssql_create_remote_relationship",
  "args": {
    "name": "user",
    "source": "mssql1",
    "table": {
      "name": "order",
      "schema": "public"
    },
    "definition": {
      "to_source": {
        "relationship_type": "object",
        "source": "mssql2",
        "table": {
          "name": "user",
          "schema": "public"
        },
        "field_mapping": {
          "user_id": "id"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Step 2: Explore with GraphiQL

Run the following query in the GraphiQL editor to test your remote database relationship across the two connected databases:

<GraphiQLIDE
  query={`query {
  order {
    id
    user_id
    user {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}`}
  response={`{
  "data": {
    "order": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "user_id": 1,
        "user": {
          "id": 1,
          "name": "Torvalds"
        }
      },
      {
        "id": 2,
        "user_id": 2,
        "user": {
          "id": 2,
          "name": "Zuckerberg"
        }
      },
      {
        "id": 3,
        "user_id": 1,
        "user": {
          "id": 1,
          "name": "Torvalds"
        }
      },
      {
        "id": 4,
        "user_id": 3,
        "user": {
          "id": 3,
          "name": "Gates"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}`}
/>
