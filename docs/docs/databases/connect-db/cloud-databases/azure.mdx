# Connecting Hasura to an Azure Postgres Database

## Introduction

This guide explains how to connect a new or existing
[Azure Postgres database](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/postgresql/) to a Hasura instance, either on
[Hasura Cloud](https://cloud.hasura.io) or via one of our [self-hosted](/deployment/deployment-guides/index.mdx)
solutions. If you're exploring Azure Postgres and are interested in migrating an existing Postgres database - such as
from Heroku - check out their
[docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dms/tutorial-postgresql-azure-postgresql-online-portal) before continuing
below.

:::info Note

If you plan on using Hasura Cloud, which we recommend, follow steps 1 and 2 below. If you're self-hosting a Hasura instance and
already have a project running, skip to [step 3](#create-pg-db-azure).

:::

## Step 1: Sign up or log in to Hasura Cloud

Navigate to [Hasura Cloud](https://cloud.hasura.io/signup/?pg=docs&plcmt=body&cta=navigate-to-hasura-cloud&tech=default)
and sign up or log in.

## Step 2: Create a Hasura Cloud project {#create-hasura-project-azure}

On the Hasura Cloud dashboard, create a new project:

<Thumbnail src='/img/cloud-dbs/create-hasura-cloud-project.png' alt='Create Hasura Cloud project' width='1000px' />

After the project is initialized successfully, click on `Launch Console` to open the Hasura Console in your browser.

On the Hasura Console, navigate to the `Data` tab and choose `Connect Existing Database`. Hasura will prompt you for a
Postgres Database URL. We'll create this in the next step and then come back here.

## Step 3: Create a Postgres DB on Azure {#create-pg-db-azure}

Log into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

On the Azure portal, type "postgres" in the search window and choose `Azure Database for PostgreSQL servers`:

<Thumbnail src='/img/cloud-dbs/azure/select-postgres-db.png' alt='Select Postgres database on Azure' />

Click the `+ Add` button to create a new Postgres database:

<Thumbnail src='/img/cloud-dbs/azure/add-postgres-db.png' alt='Add Postgres database on Azure' />

Choose the plan that fits your requirements. For this tutorial, we'll choose `Single server`:

<Thumbnail src='/img/cloud-dbs/azure/pg-single-server.png' alt='Select single server on Azure' width='600px' />

Configure your database with all required fields:

<Thumbnail src='/img/cloud-dbs/azure/configure-db.png' alt='Configure database on Azure' width='600px' />

Then click `Review + create`.

:::info Note

If you're using a database user other than the default one, make sure to give it the right
[Postgres permissions](/deployment/postgres-requirements.mdx#managed-pg-permissions).

:::

:::info Note

For Azure flexible server, Hasura v1.x does not work with
[JIT](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/runtime-config-query.html#GUC-JIT) turned on. JIT can be turned off from Azure
console. Hasura v2.x works fine with JIT enabled.

:::

## Step 4: Allow connections to your DB from Hasura

On the database dashboard, click on `Connection security` under `Settings` on the left navigation bar.

On `Allow access to Azure services`, click the `Yes` button. Then add a Firewall rule for Hasura.

If you're using Hasura Cloud, you can quickly find your IP address from the `Hasura Cloud IP` field on the project's
details view:

<Thumbnail src='/img/projects/hasura-cloud-ip.png' alt='Hasura Cloud IP field' width='1000px' />

:::info Note

If you're using a self-hosted solution, you'll need to determine the IP address manually depending on your hosting
service.

:::

Add the Hasura IP address that you copied:

<Thumbnail src='/img/cloud-dbs/azure/add-hasura-ip.png' alt='Add Hasura IP on Azure' />

Then click `Save` on the top left.

## Step 5: Construct the database connection URL {#get-db-url-azure}

The structure of the database connection URL looks as follows:

```bash
postgresql://<user-name>:<password>@<public-ip>:<postgres-port>/<db>
```

On the database dashboard, click on `Overview`:

<Thumbnail
  src='/img/cloud-dbs/azure/get-database-connection-string.png'
  alt='Construct the database connection string for Azure'
/>

- `user-name`: If you have a separate database user, the user name will be their name. If you didn't specify a user, use
  the `Admin username` (see screenshot above). **Note:** you need to escape the `@`. Replace it with `%40`.
- `password`: If you have a separate database user, use their password. Otherwise, use the password that you chose when
  creating the database.
- `public-ip`: On the screenshot above, the `Server name` is the public IP.
- `postgres-port`: The default port for Postgres is `5432`.
- `db`: The DB is `postgres` by default unless otherwise specified.

## Step 6: Finish connecting the database

Back on the Hasura Console, enter the database URL that we retrieved in [step 5](#get-db-url-azure):

<Thumbnail src='/img/cloud-dbs/azure/azure-complete.png' alt='Database setup' width='600px' />

Then click `Connect Database`.

:::info Note

For security reasons, it is recommended to set database URLs as
[env vars](/projects/env-vars.mdx#manage-project-env-vars) and using the env vars to connect to the databases in place
of the raw database URLs.

Voil√†. You are ready to start developing.

## Next steps

- You can check out our [30-Minute Hasura Basics Course](https://hasura.io/learn/graphql/hasura/introduction/) and other
  [GraphQL & Hasura Courses](https://hasura.io/learn/) for a more detailed introduction to Hasura.

- If using Hasura Cloud, you can also click the gear icon to manage your Hasura Cloud project. (e.g. add
  [collaborators](/projects/collaborators.mdx#manage-project-collaborators),
  [env vars](/projects/env-vars.mdx#manage-project-env-vars) or
  [custom domains](/projects/domains.mdx#manage-project-domains)).
