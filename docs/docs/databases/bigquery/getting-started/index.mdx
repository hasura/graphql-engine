# Get Started with BigQuery

To try Hasura with BigQuery, you'll need your own new or existing BigQuery database.

Here are two ways you can get started with Hasura:

1.  [Hasura Cloud](/databases/bigquery/getting-started/cloud.mdx): Access and manage your BigQuery database from Hasura
    Cloud.
2.  [Docker](/databases/bigquery/getting-started/docker.mdx): Run Hasura with Docker and then connect your BigQuery
    database to Hasura.

:::info Using Kubernetes?

We have Helm charts available for deploying Hasura on Kubernetes. Check out
[more information here](/deployment/deployment-guides/kubernetes-helm.mdx) and see the
[`enterprise-stack` here](https://github.com/hasura/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/hasura-enterprise-stack).
