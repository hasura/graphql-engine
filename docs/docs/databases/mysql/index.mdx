# MySQL [Preview]

## Introduction

:::info Deprecation Notice

Our current MySQL implementation is deprecated in favor of a new implementation built using our Data Connectors, to be
released shortly. Check out this [blog post](https://hasura.io/blog/hasura-graphql-data-connectors/) for more
information about Hasura GraphQL Engine Data Connectors.

If you're currently running Hasura in production with MySQL, please [reach out to us](https://hasura.io/help/)!
