# Hasura Data Connectors

## Introduction

Hasura Data Connectors provide an easy way to build connectors to any data source and instantly obtain GraphQL APIs on
that data.

Currently, Hasura natively supports Postgres, SQL Server, and BigQuery databases. Data Connectors allow you to connect
Hasura to **_any_** other data source. Hasura has used Data Connectors to build connectors to MySQL, Oracle, Snowflake,
Amazon Athena, MariaDB, MongoDB (coming soon), with more sources in the pipeline, but you can also use them to connect
to your own. Think Microsoft Excel, SQLite, CSV, AirTable and more.

For more information on databases, check out the [Hasura Databases documentation](/docs/databases/overview.mdx) or to
jump right into integrating a native database, [check out the Quickstart](/docs/databases/quickstart.mdx).

This documentation will guide you through understanding Hasura Data Connectors concepts and how to use them.

:::warning Active Development

Data Connectors are currently in active development and are likely to change considerably. We are working hard to make
them as stable as possible soon, but please be aware that breaking changes may occur.

## Hasura GraphQL Data Connector Agent

The Hasura GraphQL Data Connector Agent is a service that acts as an intermediary middleware abstraction between a data
source and the Hasura GraphQL Engine via a REST API. It allows users to implement Hasura's powerful GraphQL experience
on any data source they use. Further information about the design and implementation of the Agent service can be found
in the
[README.md of the Data Connector Agent repository](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/blob/master/dc-agents/README.md).

In addition, an agent can directly support new functionality without any other database upstream. The purpose of Data
Connector agents is to quickly and easily allow developers to author new agents to support a wide variety of new data
sources and use-cases.

## Adding Hasura GraphQL Data Connector Agent to Metadata

To use a custom Hasura GraphQL Data Connector Agent, follow the following steps on Console to add it to HGE metadata.
Before following the steps, make sure the custom connector is deployed and accessible.

<Tabs groupId="user-preference" className="api-tabs">


<TabItem value="console" label="Console">
<ol>
<li>

Navigate to the project Console to the Data tab.

</li>
<li>

Click on the `Manage` button.

<li>

Click on the `Add Agent` button.

/>
</li>
<li>

Enter the values for name and agent endpoint. Click `Connect` and you're done!

/>
</li>
<li>

Once the above is done, the new driver supported by the custom connector will be available as one of the options
in the `Connect Database` page.

</li>
</ol>
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

You can add a DC agent by adding their config to the `/metadata/backend_configs.yaml` file:

```yaml
dataconnector:
  sqlite:
    uri: <dc agent url>
```

Apply the Metadata by running:

```yaml
hasura metadata apply
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="api" label="API">

You can add a DC agent to Hasura via the `dc_add_agent` Metadata API.

```http
POST /v1/metadata HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
X-Hasura-Role: admin

{
  "type": "dc_add_agent",
  "args": {
      "name": "sqlite",
      "url": "<URL where the DC agent is deployed>"
  }
}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Hasura GraphQL Data Connector SDK

The Data Connector SDK serves as a pack of documentation and resources for understanding, building, and testing Data
Connector agent implementations to ensure that they are complete, correct, idiomatic and can be developed rapidly and
with confidence. The workflow that the SDK supports out of the box is powered by Docker Compose in order to reduce the
number of dependencies required, but each component may be run natively if desired. The SDK is versioned with the Hasura
GraphQL Engine.

The SDK including the `docker-compose.yaml` file can be
[found here](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/tree/master/dc-agents/sdk).

For more details on the SDK, check out the
[SDK repository README.md](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/blob/master/dc-agents/sdk/README.md).

### Building a New Data Connector with the SDK

To create a new Data Connector, follow these steps:

1. [Start the container](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/blob/master/dc-agents/sdk/docker-compose.yaml) with
   `docker compose up`.
2. Verify that tests pass.
3. Review & make changes to the reference connector for your specific database and intended implementation.
4. Or rebuild as required, depending on your stack.
5. Rerun the tests with `docker compose run tests`.
6. Interact with the agent via Hasura GraphQL Engine at `http://localhost:8080` and view the OpenAPI Schema at
   `http://localhost:8300`.

## Reference Connector

The reference connector is located under the `/reference` path within the SDK and serves as a working connector example.
It is written in TypeScript and has several key code snippet examples within the reference itself. For more information
on the reference connector, check out
[README in the reference directory](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/tree/master/dc-agents/reference).
