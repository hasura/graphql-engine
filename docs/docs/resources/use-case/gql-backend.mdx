# Building a GraphQL backend for an application with Hasura

## Introduction

The Hasura GraphQL Engine is a blazing-fast GraphQL server that gives you instant, real-time GraphQL APIs over many
popular databases and other data sources. Using Hasura you can build a powerful GraphQL backend that makes it easy to
build scalable and secure applications just by connecting a database and defining a schema.

## Example

This guide will outline the steps required to set up a Hasura GraphQL backend for a todos app as an example.

Our `todos app` will have the following features:

- Users can create personal to-dos
- User can mark their to-dos as completed
- Users can view public to-dos
- View a list of currently online users using the app

:::info Note

We will be using the Hasura Console in the next few steps, which is a web app to setup Hasura by just making some
clicks! If you landed on this doc and do not have the Hasura console open, we recommend you to go through one of the
quickstart guides [here](/getting-started/overview.mdx) first.

Hasura Console is a web-based graphical user interface (GUI) tool that allows users to interact with and manage their
Hasura GraphQL APIs. It provides an intuitive interface for exploring the schema, creating tables, modifying data, and
testing queries, among other things.

:::

## Step 1: Connect Database

To set up Hasura as a GraphQL backend, the first step is to establish a connection between a database and Hasura. Hasura
provides support for a wide range of databases, which can be found in the
[supported databases](/databases/overview.mdx/#supported-databases) section.

To connect your database you should navigate to the `Data` -> `Manage` -> `Connect Database` ->
`Connect Existing Database` tab in Hasura Console and enter the `Database Display Name` , `Database URL` and click the
`Connect Database` button.

If you dont have a database to connect, you can get started with a free <a href="https://neon.tech/" >Neon</a> Postgres
database by navigating to the `Data` -> `Manage` -> `Connect Database` -> `Connect New Database` tab in Hasura Console
and clicking on the `Connect Neon Database` button.

After successfully connecting the database you can select `View Database` in the notification to view your database.

## Step 2: Data modeling

Data modeling is a crucial step in building a backend for your application. Its important to define your schema based on
the backend logic of your app. This involves considering the relationships between your data and how it will be stored
and retrieved.

In the `todos app` example, we have two main models in this app: `users` and `todos`, each with its own set of
properties.

The final model looks like the following:

![Schema Todo app](https://graphql-engine-cdn.hasura.io/learn-hasura/assets/graphql-hasura/voyager-schema.png)

As we create tables using the Console or directly on postgres, the Hasura GraphQL Engine automatically creates GraphQL
APIs to access the data.

### Step 2.1: Create Tables

Hasura makes this easy by providing a schema builder that allows you to create tables and relationships visually.

After you have connected a database, to create a table, click on the `Data` tab in the Hasura Console, and then click
the `Create Table` button. You'll be prompted to enter a table name and the columns you want to include in the table.
You can also specify relationships between tables, which will be used to generate GraphQL queries and mutations
automatically.

For the todo-app let's get started by creating the `users` table.

The `users` table will have the following columns:

- `id` (type Text and Unique),
- `name` (type Text),
- `created_at` (type Timestamp and default now())
- `last_seen` (type Timestamp and nullable)

The columns are associated with properties of users. The `last_seen` column is used to store the latest timestamp of
when the user was online.

![Create table users](https://graphql-engine-cdn.hasura.io/learn-hasura/assets/graphql-hasura/create-table-users.png)

Once you are done, click on `Add Table` button to create the table.

Similarly we can create a `todos` table having following items:

- `id` (type Integer (auto-increment)),
- `title` (type Text),
- `is_completed` (type Boolean and default false)
- `is_public` (type Boolean and default false)
- `created_at` (type Timestamp and default now())
- `user_id` (type Text)

## Step 3: Explore GraphQL API

To query data using Hasura, you can use any GraphQL client that supports HTTP requests, such as GraphQL Playground,
Postman, or Insomnia.

Hasura gives you instant GraphQL APIs over tables and views existing in your database. For example, for the todos app,
you can start exploring the GraphQL API for the users table. We are going to use GraphiQL to explore the API.

GraphiQL is the GraphQL integrated development environment (IDE). It's a powerful tool to interact with the API.

You can access GraphiQL by heading over to the `API` tab.

Here's how to explore the GraphQL APIs for the todos app example:

### Step 3.1: Mutation {#mutation}

We can add a user using a [GraphQL Mutation](https://hasura.io/learn/graphql/intro-graphql/graphql-queries/). Copy the
following code into the GraphiQL interface.

```graphql
mutation {
  insert_users(objects: [{ id: "1", name: "user_1" }]) {
    affected_rows
  }
}
```

Click on the `Play` button on the GraphiQL interface to execute the query.

You should get a response looking something like this:

<Thumbnail src="/img/resources/hasura-as-gql-backend/Mutation.png" alt="Cloud Dashboard" width="800px" />

Great! You have just successfully run a mutation on the `users` table that you just created.

**Tip**: You can use the `Explorer` on the GraphiQL interface to generate the mutation in a few clicks.

### Step 3.2: Query {#query}

Here is how to [query](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/queries/index/) the data that we just inserted.

```graphql
query {
  users {
    id
    name
    created_at
  }
}
```

You should get a response that looks something like this:

<Thumbnail src="/img/resources/hasura-as-gql-backend/query.png" alt="Cloud Dashboard" width="800px" />

Note that some columns like `created_at` have default values, even though you did not insert them during the mutation.

### Step 3.3: Subscription {#subscription}

If a client subscribes to a specific query using a GraphQL subscription, it will receive real-time updates whenever
there are changes to the data returned by that query. This means that if a new record is added to the database that
matches the subscribed query, the client will immediately receive a notification about the new data, without having to
make a new API request.

For the `todos app`, we can run a [subscription](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/subscriptions/index/) over `users` table
to watch for changes to the table in realtime without having to query every time.

```graphql
subscription {
  users {
    id
    name
    created_at
  }
}
```

In a new tab, try adding more records into your `users` table and see the records being updated in the running
subscription.

## Step 4: Create Relationships

Relationships are the connections between different tables in a relational database. By defining relationships between
tables in a database schema, you can access data across tables using GraphQL queries without having to write complex SQL
join statements.

GraphQL schema relationships can be either

- **object relationships (one-to-one)**: In a one-to-one relationship, one object is linked to only one other object of
  another type. For our `todo app` example, a single `to-do` entry corresponds only to only one user. may have one
  profile picture. In this case, the `to-do` object type would have a single field that references the `user` object
  type. This type of relationship is useful when you have a strict one-to-one mapping between objects.

- **array relationships (one-to-many)**: In a in a one-to-many relationship, one object is linked to multiple objects of
  another type. For our `todo app`example, a `user` may have many `to-dos` In this case, the `user` object type would
  have a field that returns a list of `to-do` objects. This type of relationship is useful when you have multiple
  related objects of the same type.

### Step 4.1: Create Foreign Key

A foreign key is a type of database constraint that ensures that the values in a column or set of columns in one table
match the values in another table's primary key. In other words, it creates a link between two tables that is enforced
by the database.

For the `todos app` in the `todos` table, the value of `user_id` column must be ideally present in the `id` column of
`users` table. Otherwise, it would result in inconsistent data.

Here we can define a foreign key called `user_id` column in `todos`. For this head over to `Console` -> `DATA` ->
`todos` -> `Modify` page.

![Todos Modify Page](https://graphql-engine-cdn.hasura.io/learn-hasura/assets/graphql-hasura/todos-modify-page.png)

Scroll down to `Foreign Keys` section at the bottom and click on `Add`.

![user_id foreign key](https://graphql-engine-cdn.hasura.io/learn-hasura/assets/graphql-hasura/user-id-foreign-key.png)

- Select the Reference table as `users`
- Choose the From column as `user_id` and To column as `id`

We are enforcing that the `user_id` column of `todos` table must be one of the values of `id` in `users` table.

Click on `Save` to create the foreign key.

Great! Now you have ensured data consistency.

### Step 4.2: Create Relationship

Now that the foreign key constraint is created, Hasura Console automatically suggests relationships based on that.

Head over to `Relationships` tab under `todos` table and you should see a suggested relationship like below:

![Todos Relationships Page](https://graphql-engine-cdn.hasura.io/learn-hasura/assets/graphql-hasura/todos-relationship-page.png)

Click on `Add` in the suggested object relationship.

Enter the relationship name as `user` (already pre-filled) and click on `Save`.

![User Object Relationship](https://graphql-engine-cdn.hasura.io/learn-hasura/assets/graphql-hasura/todos-relationship-user.png)

A relationship has now been established between todos and users table. We can now run queries with nesting.

```graphql
query {
  todos {
    id
    title
    user {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```

You can see the response in the following format:

<Thumbnail src="/img/resources/hasura-as-gql-backend/nested-query.png" alt="Cloud Dashboard" width="800px" />

Great! Now you know the basics of setting up Hasura Graphql Backend and using the Instantly Generated GraphQL APIs.

## Step 5: Set Authorization rules

Hasura provides a robust access control system that enables users to specify which users can access specific data,
ensuring that their application is secure. Hasura offers Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with granular row/column level
properties. Access control rules help in restricting querying on a table based on certain conditions.

In this realtime `todos app` example, certain columns in tables do not need to be exposed to the user. The aim of the
app is to allow users to manage their own todos only but should be able to view all the public todos.

To implement this in Hasura, head over to the `Permissions` tab under `todos` table to add relevant permissions. We want
to allow logged-in users creating a new todo entry to only specify the `is_public` and `title` columns.

- In the enter new role textbox, type in `user`
- Click on edit (pencil) icon for `insert` permissions. This would open up a section below, which lets you configure
  custom checks and allow columns.
- In the custom check, choose the following condition

```json
{ "user_id": { "_eq": "X-Hasura-User-Id" } }
```

Under "Column insert permissions", select the `title` and `is_public` columns. Below "Column presets", select `user_id`
from `from session variable` mapping to `X-HASURA-USER-ID`.

<Thumbnail src="/img/resources/hasura-as-gql-backend/insert-permission.png" alt="Cloud Dashboard" width="800px" />

:::info Session variables are key-value pairs returned from the authentication service for each request. When a user
makes a request, the session token maps to a `USER-ID`. This `USER-ID` can be used in permission to show that inserts
into a table are only allowed if the `user_id` column has a value equal to that of `USER-ID`, the session variable. :::
Click on `Save Permissions`.

Similarly you can setup `Select`, `Update` and `Delete`permissions and permissions for the `todos table`.

## Advanced topics

Up until now, we have addressed the data-modeling and relationships part of constructing a backend. However, Hasura
offers numerous sophisticated functionalities for handling custom business logic, security, caching, monitoring, and a
variety of other features. In the following section, we will discuss some of the very useful topics briefly.

### Actions

Actions are a way to execute arbitrary code or scripts in response to a GraphQL mutation. With actions, you can extend
your GraphQL API beyond simple database queries and mutations, and incorporate business logic, third-party APIs, and
other external services.

To add an action to send todo notification via the Hasura console, follow these steps:

Open the Hasura console and navigate to the `Actions` tab. Click on the `Create` button to create a new action. In the
Action Definition section, define a GraphQL mutation with the required input parameters for the action.

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/actions/actions-quickstart_step-1_console_2-17-0.png"
  alt="Click create for new Action"
  className="no-shadow"
  width="800px"
/>

For example, if you want to add a new todo and send a notification to the user who created it, you can define a mutation
like this:

```graphql
mutation AddTodoAndNotify($todo: String!, $userId: Int!) {
  insert_todos(objects: { todo: $todo, user_id: $userId }) {
    affected_rows
  }
  send_notification(name: "john_doe", message: "A new todo has been added")
}
```

In the `Webhook (HTTP/S) Handler` section, enter the `URL` of the endpoint that will receive the action request and
process it.

In the `Configure REST Connectors` section, modify the payload if necessary to send the required data to the endpoint.

Click the `Create Action` button to save the action and test it by going to the API Explorer and selecting the
corresponding mutation. Provide the input parameters and execute the mutation to trigger the action.

### Event triggers

Event triggers are a way to execute a GraphQL mutation in response to a database event such as an insert, update, or
delete. With event triggers, you can automate workflows and perform real-time processing of data changes.

For our `todos app` we can set up an event trigger to send welcome email for new user who signs up. We can do this by
creating an Event Trigger that calls out to a webhook whenever a new user is inserted into the users table. The webhook
payload will contain the user's email address, and we can use this in the endpoint which we create to send them the
welcome email.

Navigate to the `Event` tab in the Console and click the `Create` button while on the `Event Triggers` tab in the left
navigation.

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/event-triggers/event-triggers_main-screen_2-19-0.png"
  alt="Click create for new Action"
  width="800px"
/>

On the Event Trigger creation page, input the name of the trigger, `send_welcome_email`, and select the database, schema
and table that the trigger will be listening to. In this case we'll be listening to the `users` table for an INSERT
event.

In the `Webhook (HTTP/S) Handler` section, enter the `URL` of the endpoint to be called when the event is triggered.

Click `Create Event Trigger` button to save the event trigger and test it by going to the API Explorer and selecting the
corresponding mutation. Provide the input parameters and execute the mutation to trigger the action.

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/event-triggers/event-triggers_create-event-trigger_2-19-0.png"
  alt="Click create for new Action"
  width="800px"
/>

### Authentication

Hasura authentication is a feature that allows users to authenticate with Hasura and access data through GraphQL
queries. The authentication process involves two main components: authentication providers and authorization rules.

Authentication providers are services that handle the authentication process for Hasura. Hasura supports several
authentication providers, including email/password, social media logins (such as Google, Facebook, and GitHub), and
third-party authentication services (such as Auth0 and Firebase).

In case of `todos app` example, we have a users table in the database. The data of customers signing up can go into this
table. With Hasura, it is very easy to set up JWT based authentication.

Here's what the flow for a login with JWT looks like.

<Thumbnail src="/img/resources/hasura-as-gql-backend/auth-jwt-mode.png" alt="JWT auth" width="800px" />

The REST API call to your custom Node.js server can be queried via GraphQL on the same endpoint that Hasura provides.

Hasura Actions can be used to extend the auto-generated GraphQL types. Actions are a way to extend Hasura’s schema with
custom business logic using custom queries and mutations.

Custom mutation for signup would look very simple:

```graphql
mutation {
  signup(name: "user_1", id: "1", password: "password") {
    id
    token
  }
}
```

The server generates JWT token using a custom secret shared with Hasura and returns the token back to the client after
inserting the user into the database.

On the other hand, you can also make use of Auth providers like Auth0, Firebase, Cognito which works well with
[Hasura's Auth system](/auth/authentication/index.mdx).

## Conclusion

Using Hasura as a GraphQL backend can simplify the process of building complex applications. By defining your data
schema, adding business logic, and securing your API with Hasura, you can focus on building a great user experience.
