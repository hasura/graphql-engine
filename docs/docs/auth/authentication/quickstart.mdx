# Quickstart

Implementing auth in your project is not always a quick and easy process and extreme care should be taken to get it
right due to the nature of security. We strongly recommend that you use a third party authentication service
which can help you utilize trusted, tested, and best-practice methods to keep your app as secure as possible.

We have an extensive set of tutorials for implementing auth with Hasura Engine. We recommend that you choose and
follow one of these for the best possible experience when setting up your project.
