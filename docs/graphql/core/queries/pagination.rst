The **limit** & **offset** arguments
------------------------------------

The operators ``limit`` and ``offset`` are used for pagination.

``limit`` specifies the number of rows to retain from the result set and ``offset`` determines which slice to
retain from the results.

You can see the complete specification of the ``limit`` and ``offset`` arguments in the
:ref:`API reference <PaginationExp>`.

The following are examples of different pagination scenarios:

Limit results
-------------
**Example:** Fetch the first 5 authors from the list of all authors:

.. graphiql::
  :view_only:
  :query:
    query {
      author(
        limit: 5
      ) {
        id
        name
      }
    }
  :response:
    {
      "data": {
        "author": [
          {
            "id": 1,
            "name": "Justin"
          },
          {
            "id": 2,
            "name": "Beltran"
          },
          {
            "id": 3,
            "name": "Sidney"
          },
          {
            "id": 4,
            "name": "Anjela"
          },
          {
            "id": 5,
            "name": "Amii"
          }
        ]
      }
    }

Limit results from an offset
----------------------------
**Example:** Fetch 5 authors from the list of all authors, starting with the 6th one:

.. graphiql::
  :view_only:
  :query:
    query {
      author(
        limit: 5,
        offset:5
      ) {
        id
        name
      }
    }
  :response:
    {
      "data": {
        "author": [
          {
            "id": 6,
            "name": "Corny"
          },
          {
            "id": 7,
            "name": "Berti"
          },
          {
            "id": 8,
            "name": "April"
          },
          {
            "id": 9,
            "name": "Ninnetta"
          },
          {
            "id": 10,
            "name": "Lyndsay"
          }
        ]
      }
    }

.. _nested_paginate:

Limit results in a nested object
--------------------------------
**Example:** Fetch a list of authors and a list of their first 2 articles:

.. graphiql::
  :view_only:
  :query:
    query {
      author {
        id
        name
        articles (
          limit: 2
          offset: 0
        ) {
          id
          title
        }
      }
    }
  :response:
    {
      "data": {
        "author": [
          {
            "id": 1,
            "name": "Justin",
            "articles": [
              {
                "id": 15,
                "title": "vel dapibus at"
              },
              {
                "id": 16,
                "title": "sem duis aliquam"
              }
            ]
          },
          {
            "id": 2,
            "name": "Beltran",
            "articles": [
              {
                "id": 2,
                "title": "a nibh"
              },
              {
                "id": 9,
                "title": "sit amet"
              }
            ]
          },
          {
            "id": 3,
            "name": "Sidney",
            "articles": [
              {
                "id": 6,
                "title": "sapien ut"
              },
              {
                "id": 11,
                "title": "turpis eget"
              }
            ]
          },
          {
            "id": 4,
            "name": "Anjela",
            "articles": [
              {
                "id": 1,
                "title": "sit amet"
              },
              {
                "id": 3,
                "title": "amet justo morbi"
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    }

Keyset cursor based pagination
------------------------------

Cursors are used to traverse across rows of a dataset. They work by returning a pointer to a specific row which can
then be used to fetch the next batch of data.

Keyset cursors are a column (or a set of columns) of the data that are used as the cursor. The column(s) used as the
cursor must be unique and sequential. This ensures that data is read after a specific row rather than relying on the
position of the row in the dataset as done by ``offset``, and that duplicate records are not fetched again.

**For example**, consider the following query to fetch a list of authors with a ``where`` clause used in place of
``offset``:

.. graphiql::
  :view_only:
  :query:
    query {
      author(
        limit: 5,
        where: { id: {_gt: 5} }
      ) {
        id
        name
      }
    }
  :response:
    {
      "data": {
        "author": [
          {
            "id": 6,
            "name": "Corny"
          },
          {
            "id": 7,
            "name": "Berti"
          },
          {
            "id": 8,
            "name": "April"
          },
          {
            "id": 9,
            "name": "Ninnetta"
          },
          {
            "id": 10,
            "name": "Lyndsay"
          }
        ]
      }
    }

Here we are fetching authors where the value of ``id`` is greater than 5. This will always skip the previously fetched
results which would have been ids 1 to 5, ensuring no duplicate results. Column ``id`` is acting as the cursor here,
unique and sequential.

The choice of cursor columns depends on the order of the expected results i.e. if the query has an ``order_by``
clause, the column(s) used in the ``order_by`` need to be used as the cursor.

Columns such as ``id`` (auto-incrementing integer/big integer) or ``created_at`` (timestamp) are commonly used as
cursors when an order is not explicit, as they should be unique and sequential.


.. note::

  Keyset cursor based pagination using ``where`` is more performant than using ``offset`` because we can leverage
  database indexes on the columns that are being used as cursors.

Fetch limited results along with data aggregated over all results *(e.g. total count)* in the same query
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sometimes, some aggregated information on all the data is required along with a subset of data.

E.g. the total count of results can be returned along with a page of results. The count can then be used to calculate
the number of pages based on the limit that is set.

**Example:** Fetch a list of articles where a certain condition is true and get their count. Then limit the number of
articles to return.

.. graphiql::
  :view_only:
  :query:
    query articles ($where: articles_bool_exp!) {
      articles_aggregate(where: $where) {
        aggregate {
          totalCount: count
        }
      }
      articles (where: $where limit: 4) {
        id
        title
      }
    }
  :response:
    {
      "data": {
        "articles_aggregate": {
          "aggregate": {
            "totalCount": 8
          }
        },
        "articles": [
          {
            "id": 33,
            "title": "How to make fajitas"
          },
          {
            "id": 31,
            "title": "How to make fajitas"
          },
          {
            "id": 32,
            "title": "How to make fajitas"
          },
          {
            "id": 2,
            "title": "How to climb mount everest"
          }
        ]
      }
    }

.. admonition:: Caveat

  If this needs to be done over :ref:`subscriptions <subscriptions>`, two subscriptions will need to be run
  as Hasura follows the `GraphQL spec <https://graphql.github.io/graphql-spec/June2018/#sec-Single-root-field>`__ which
  allows for only one root field in a subscription.
