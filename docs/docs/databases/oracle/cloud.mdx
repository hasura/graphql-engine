# Getting Started with Oracle in Hasura Cloud

<div className="badge-container">
  <div className="badge badge--primary heading-badge">Available on: Hasura Cloud</div>
  <div className="badge badge-gray heading-badge">Alpha</div>
</div>

## Introduction

This guide will help you get set up with [Hasura Cloud](/hasura-cloud/overview.mdx) and our Oracle integration.

:::tip Supported versions

1.  Hasura GraphQL Engine `v2.21.0` onwards
2.  Oracle version 18.0 and higher

:::

:::tip Alpha version supported features

Hasura currently supports queries, table relationships and permissions on Oracle.

Note that Hasura doesn't yet support the ability to modify the database schema, so the database you
connect to should already contain tables and data. You should also ideally have access to it outside of Hasura to
modify the schema.

:::

## Try it out

### Step 1: Create an account on Hasura Cloud and create a new Hasura Project

Navigate to
[cloud.hasura.io](https://cloud.hasura.io/signup/?pg=docs&plcmt=body&cta=navigate-to-cloud-hasura-io&tech=default), and
create a new Hasura Cloud account.

Once you create a project on Hasura Cloud, hit the "Launch Console" button to open the Hasura Console for your project.

### Step 2: Connect to a Oracle database

From the Console, click the `Data` tab:

<Thumbnail src="/img/getting-started/connect-db-console.png" alt="Connect database" width="1000px" />

Select the Oracle (Alpha) data source driver. Enter a database display name and the JDBC Connection URL for your
Oracle instance.

The JDBC connection URL should look like this:

```yaml {4-6}
jdbc:oracle:thin:<username>/<password>@<hostname>:<port>:<service-name>
```

For example:
```yaml {4-6}
jdbc:oracle:thin:myuser/mypassword@myhost.mycompany.com:oracletest  # assuming the default port 1521
jdbc:oracle:thin:myuser/mypassword@myhost.mycompany.com:1234:oracletest  # assuming Oracle is running on port 1234
```

Click `Connect Database`.

### Step 3: Track tables and run GraphQL API queries

Now that you have successfully connected your Oracle database to Hasura, you can track tables and use Hasura to
automatically build a GraphQL API on top of it.
