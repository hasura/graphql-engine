# Actions

## What are actions?

Actions are a way to extend Hasura's schema with custom business logic
using custom queries and mutations. Actions can be added to Hasura to
handle various use cases such as data validation, data enrichment from
external sources and any other complex business logic.

:::tip Supported from

Actions are supported in Hasura GraphQL engine versions `v1.2.0` and above.

Actions are supported for **Postgres versions 10 and above**.

## Action description

An action consists of the following parts:

1.  `Type`: The type of the action (`query` or `mutation`)
2.  `Definition`: The definition of the query or mutation
3.  `Handler`: The logic to be run when the query or mutation is
    executed
4.  `Kind`: Sync or async. In case of a query action, there is no `Kind`
    associated with it. A query action is always sync

### Type

Actions can be of two types:

-   **Query action**: An action of type `query` extends the query root
    of the Hasura schema. This means that you can execute this action
    through a GraphQL query. Query actions must be used where you want
    to fetch data from a data source without changing anything on the
    data source.
-   **Mutation action**: An action of type `mutation` extends the
    mutation root of the Hasura schema. This means that you can execute
    this action through a GraphQL mutation. Mutation actions must be
    used when you want to mutate the state of a data source and fetch
    some data.

### Definition

The action definition consists of the following:

- `Action Name`: The action will be available as a query or mutation
  in the GraphQL schema named as the action name
- `Arguments`: Arguments are used to pass dynamic values along with
  the query/mutation.
- `Response type`: The GraphQL type of the response that the query or
  mutation will return. Actions can only return object types or scalar types currently.

For instance, consider this action definition:

```graphql
extend type Mutation {
  userLogin(username: String!, password: String!): UserInfo
}
```

In case the action response is a scalar (eg. Int), the action can also be defined as:

```graphql
type Mutation {
  userLogin(username: String!, password: String!): Int!
}
```

In this definition, we are extending the mutation root with an action
called `userLogin`.

- `userLogin` is the action name
- `username` and `password` are the arguments that accept non-nullable
  string values.
- `UserInfo` is the response type of the action


**Custom Types**

In case the action returns an object type, you will have to define your custom types like so:

```graphql
type UserInfo {
  accessToken: String!
  userId: Int!
}
```

Read more about [custom types](/graphql/core/actions/types.mdx).

### Handler

Once you define the action types, you also have to specify the logic to
run when the action is executed. This can be done in an HTTP webhook,
also called the action handler. It could be a REST endpoint or a
serverless function.

Learn more about [writing an action handler](/graphql/core/actions/action-handlers.mdx).

### Kind

**Mutation actions** are of two kinds:

-   **Synchronous**: Sync actions return a response to the client after
    receiving a response from the handler.
-   **Asynchronous**: [Async actions](/graphql/core/actions/async-actions.mdx) return an
    `action id` as response to the client before receiving a response
    from the handler and allow the client to subscribe to the actual
    response using the `action id`.

**Query actions** don't have a kind, they always behave like sync
mutation actions.

## How it works?

-   Hasura receives the action GraphQL query or mutation and converts
    this request into an event payload.
-   The event is captured, persisted and then delivered to the action
    handler with the appropriate retry/delivery guarantees.
-   The action handler runs and returns a response that is captured as
    an event and again persisted to the event store.
-   The action response is returned to the client synchronously or
    asynchronously based on the kind.

## Actions vs. remote schemas

Both actions and remote schemas can be used to extend Hasura with
business logic. However, they have slightly different use cases.

**Actions**

Actions can be used when we want to call a REST endpoint from Hasura as
a resolver for some custom types. They are especially useful for setting
up serverless functions as resolvers.

**Remote schemas**

If you have an existing GraphQL API or if you're comfortable building a
GraphQL server yourself, you can use [remote schemas](/graphql/core/remote-schemas/index.mdx)
to add custom types and resolvers.
