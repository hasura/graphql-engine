# Downgrading Hasura GraphQL engine

## Step 1: Update Hasura GraphQL engine image version

The Hasura GraphQL engine runs off a Docker image and downgrades are as
simple as changing the image tag to the version you want.

Based on your deployment method, follow the appropriate guide to
downgrade the GraphQL engine version you're running:

- [Updating on Heroku](/graphql/core/deployment/deployment-guides/heroku.mdx#heroku-update)
- [Updating on Docker](/graphql/core/deployment/deployment-guides/docker.mdx#docker-update)
- [Updating on Kubernetes](/graphql/core/deployment/deployment-guides/kubernetes.mdx#kubernetes-update)

If the GraphQL engine version you are downgrading to has a different
catalogue version than your current, you will have to downgrade the
catalogue to the corresponding version manually as described below.

## Step 2: Downgrade Hasura catalogue version

The Hasura GraphQL engine maintains its metadata state in a "catalogue"
as described [here](/graphql/core/how-it-works/metadata-schema.mdx). The schema of the
catalogue is versioned. Updates to the Hasura GraphQL engine may have
Hasura catalogue version bumps.

Downgrades to the catalogue need to be carried out manually in case you
are attempting to downgrade to a lower Hasura GraphQL engine version.

From `v1.2.0`, you can downgrade the catalogue from a particular version
to a previous version by executing the `graphql-engine` executable on
the command line, with the `downgrade` command, specifying the desired
catalogue version using one of the `--to-` flags. For earlier versions,
it is recommended to first upgrade to the latest version and then use
the `downgrade` command to downgrade to the desired version.

The `downgrade` command is not part of the Hasura CLI but rather a
command on `graphql-engine` itself. The way to execute this command is
to run:

```bash
docker run -e HASURA_GRAPHQL_DATABASE_URL=$DATABASE_URL hasura/graphql-engine:<VERSION> graphql-engine downgrade --to-<NEW-VERSION>
```

You need to use a newer version of `graphql-engine` to downgrade to an
older version, since only the newer version knows how to downgrade from
that point in time. After youâ€™ve executed the `downgrade` command using
the newer version, you should switch to the older version and run
`graphql-engine serve` as normal.

Catalogue version downgrades will be executed sequentially and in a
single transaction.

:::info Note

Running this command while Hasura GraphQL engine is running might lead
to unexpected results. It is recommended to first bring down any running
Hasura GraphQL engine instances before downgrading the catalogue

:::info Note

You can downgrade a Hasura GraphQL engine v2 instance to v1 only if
there is only one database connected to it.
