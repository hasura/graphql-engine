# Postgres: Renaming relationships

An existing relationship can be renamed as follows:

<Tabs className="api-tabs">
<TabItem value="console" label="Console">

-   Head to `Data -> [table-name] -> Relationships` in the console
-   Drop the existing relationship
-   Recreate the relationship with the new name

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

You can rename a relationship by changing the relationship name in the
`tables.yaml` file inside the `metadata` directory:

```yaml {5}
- table:
    schema: public
    name: articles
  object_relationships:
  - name: author
    using:
      foreign_key_constraint_on: author_id
- table:
    schema: public
    name: authors
```

Apply the metadata by running:

```bash
hasura metadata apply
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="api" label="API">

You can rename a relationship by using the
[pg_rename_relationship](/graphql/core/api-reference/metadata-api/relationship.mdx#metadata-pg-rename-relationship) metadata API:

```http
POST /v1/metadata HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
X-Hasura-Role: admin

{
  "type": "pg_rename_relationship",
  "args": {
    "source": "<db_name>",
    "table": "articles",
    "name": "article_details",
    "new_name": "article_detail"
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info Note

You might not be allowed to drop a relationship if it has been
referenced elsewhere (e.g. in a permissions rule).

In this case you will have to delete the references first, rename the
relationship, and then re-add the references.
