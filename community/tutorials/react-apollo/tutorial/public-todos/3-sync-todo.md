title: "Sync new todos"
---

Once a new todo is entered in a public list, it needs to appear in the UI. Instead of automatically displaying the todo in the UI, we use a Feed like Notification banner which appears whenever a new todo is received.

Remember that previously we updated the cache using the store API and the UI got updated automatically, because updating the cache triggered a re-render for those components that were subscribed to this store.

We are not going to use that approach here since we don't want public list UI to be automatically update. As you know we are already maintaining the todo list in react state.
