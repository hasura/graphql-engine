# Updating Hasura GraphQL engine

## Update guides

The Hasura GraphQL engine runs off a Docker image and updates are as
simple as changing the image tag.

Based on your deployment method, follow the appropriate guide to update
the GraphQL engine version you're running:

- [Updating on Heroku](/graphql/core/deployment/deployment-guides/heroku.mdx#heroku-update)
- [Updating on Docker](/graphql/core/deployment/deployment-guides/docker.mdx#docker-update)
- [Updating on Kubernetes](/graphql/core/deployment/deployment-guides/kubernetes.mdx#kubernetes-update)
- [Updating on Digital Ocean](/graphql/core/deployment/deployment-guides/digital-ocean-one-click.mdx#do-updating)
