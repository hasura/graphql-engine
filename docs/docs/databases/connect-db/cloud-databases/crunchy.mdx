# Connecting Hasura to a Crunchy Postgres Database

## Introduction

This guide explains how to connect a new or existing [Crunchy Postgres](https://www.crunchydata.com/) database to a
Hasura instance, either on [Hasura Cloud](https://cloud.hasura.io) or via one of our
[self-hosted](/deployment/deployment-guides/index.mdx) solutions. If you're exploring Crunchy Postgres and are
interested in migrating an existing Postgres database - such as from Heroku - check out their
[docs](https://www.crunchydata.com/migrate-from-heroku) before continuing below.

:::info Note

If you plan on using Hasura Cloud, which we recommend, follow steps 1 and 2 below. If you're self-hosting a Hasura instance and
already have a project running, skip to [step 3](#create-pg-db-crunchy).

:::

## Step 1: Sign up or log in to Hasura Cloud

Navigate to [Hasura Cloud](https://cloud.hasura.io/signup/?pg=docs&plcmt=body&cta=navigate-to-hasura-cloud&tech=default)
and sign up or log in.

## Step 2: Create a Hasura Cloud project {#create-hasura-project}

On the Hasura Cloud dashboard, create a new project:

After the project is initialized successfully, click on `Launch Console` to open the Hasura Console in your browser.

On the Hasura Console, navigate to the `Data` tab and choose `Connect Existing Database`. Hasura will prompt you for a
Postgres Database URL. We'll create this in the next step and then come back here.

## Step 3: Create a Postgres DB on Crunchy {#create-pg-db-crunchy}

Log into [Crunchy](https://crunchybridge.com/dashboard).

From your dashboard, click `Create Cluster`:

Fill in the necessary information and click `Create Cluster`:

  width='700px'
/>

:::info Note

After creating the cluster, you'll be redirected to its dashboard. Keep an eye on the `Status` row of the Cluster
Overview card. While you can access your connection string immediately, the cluster must first be provisioned in order
for Hasura to be able to connect.

:::

Congratulations! You've now created a Postgres instance on Crunchy which you can use with Hasura GraphQL Engine. Follow
the steps below to connect it to Hasura.

## Step 4: Get the database connection URL {#get-db-url}

The structure of the database connection URL looks as follows:

```bash
postgres://<user-name>:<password>@<host-server>:<port>/<database-name>
```

Click on the Hasura card to see your connection string:

<Thumbnail

  alt='Create a new cluster with Crunchy'
  width='700px'
/>

At the bottom of the instructions, we'll select `Superuser` (which will be `postgres`) for our role:

<Thumbnail
  src='/img/cloud-dbs/crunchy/crunchy-connection-string-user.png'
  alt='Create a new cluster with Crunchy'
  width='700px'
/>

Copy the connection string:

  alt='Create a new cluster with Crunchy'
  width='700px'
/>

## Step 5: Finish connecting the database

Back on the Hasura Console, enter the database URL that we retrieved in the previous step:

<Thumbnail
  src='/img/cloud-dbs/render/render-connect-db.png'
  alt='Connect the database on Hasura Console'
  width='700px'
/>

Then click `Connect Database`.

:::info Note

For security reasons, it is recommended to set database URLs as
[env vars](/projects/env-vars.mdx#manage-project-env-vars) and using the env vars to connect to the databases in place
of the raw database URLs.

:::

Voilà. You are ready to start developing.

## Next steps

- You can check out our [30-Minute Hasura Basics Course](https://hasura.io/learn/graphql/hasura/introduction/) and other
  [GraphQL & Hasura Courses](https://hasura.io/learn/) for a more detailed introduction to Hasura.

- If using Hasura Cloud, you can also click the gear icon to manage your Hasura Cloud project. (e.g. add
  [collaborators](/projects/collaborators.mdx#manage-project-collaborators),
  [env vars](/projects/env-vars.mdx#manage-project-env-vars) or
  [custom domains](/projects/domains.mdx#manage-project-domains)).
