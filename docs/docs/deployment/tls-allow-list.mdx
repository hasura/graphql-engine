# Insecure TLS Allow List

## Introduction

Transport Layer Security (TLS) is the successor to and improved protocol of SSL. It works in much the same way as
SSL, using encryption to protect the transfer of data and information and secure HTTP traffic.

The TLS Allow List represents a set of services in Hasura GraphQL Engine that are permitted to use self-signed CA
certificates - primarily intended for use in development and staging environments. These services can be whitelisted
by a host domain, and optionally a (service id) port.

## Add and remove hosts from the TLS allow list

<Tabs groupId="user-preference" className="api-tabs">
<TabItem value="console" label="Console">

To add a host to the insecure TLS allow list in the Console go to the `Settings` tab (âš™) tab and click on
`Insecure TLS Allow List` in the left sidebar. Click on _Add Domain_ and enter the host domain and port (if
applicable). Click on _Add to Allow List_ to add the host to the allow list.

To remove the host, click the _Delete_ button.

To add a host to the insecure TLS allow list using metadata, go to the `metadata -> network.yaml` file, add the host
domain and port (if applicable) to the `tls_allowlist` section.

```yaml
tls_allowlist:
  - host: localhost
    permissions:
      - self-signed
    suffix: "4183"
```

Apply the Metadata by running:

```yaml
hasura metadata apply
```

To remove a host from the list, delete the entry and reapply the metadata.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="api" label="API">

To add a host to the TLS allow list using the API execute the following request with your defined host domain and
port (if applicable):

```http
POST /v1/metadata HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
X-Hasura-Role: admin

{
  "type": "add_host_to_tls_allowlist",
  "args": {
    "host": "localhost",
    "suffix": "4183",
    "permissions": ["self-signed"]
  }
}
```

To remove a host from the list, execute the following request with the domain you want to remove:

```http
POST /v1/metadata HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
X-Hasura-Role: admin

{
  "type": "drop_host_from_tls_allowlist",
  "args": {
    "host": "localhost",
    "suffix": "4183"
  }
}
```

For more information see the [API reference](/api-reference/metadata-api/network.mdx#tls-allowlist).
