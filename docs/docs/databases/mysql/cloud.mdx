# Getting Started with MySQL in Hasura Cloud

<div className="badge-container">
  <ProductBadge free standard pro ee />
  <div className="badge badge-gray heading-badge">Alpha</div>
</div>

## Introduction

This guide will help you get set up with [Hasura Cloud](/hasura-cloud/overview.mdx) and our MySQL integration. This is
the easiest way to set up Hasura Engine and the MySQL GraphQL Data Connector.

:::tip Supported versions:

1.  Hasura GraphQL Engine `v2.19.0` onwards
2.  MySQL version 8.0 and higher
3.  Currently only standard implementations of MySQL are supported. PlanetScale and certain other providers are
    unsupported.

:::

:::tip Alpha version supported features

Hasura currently supports queries, mutations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE), table relationships, remote relationships and permissions on MySQL.

Note that Hasura doesn't yet support the ability to modify the database schema for MySQL, so the database you connect to
should already contain tables and data. You should also ideally have access to it outside of Hasura to modify the
schema.

## Try it out

### Step 1: Create an account on Hasura Cloud and create a new Hasura Project

Navigate to
[cloud.hasura.io](https://cloud.hasura.io/signup/?pg=docs&plcmt=body&cta=navigate-to-cloud-hasura-io&tech=default), and
create a new Hasura Cloud account.

Once you create a project on Hasura Cloud, hit the "Launch Console" button to open the Hasura Console for your project.

### Step 2: Connect to a MySQL database

From the Console, click the `Data` tab:

<Thumbnail src="/img/getting-started/connect-db-console.png" alt="Connect database" width="1000px" />

Select the MySQL (Alpha) data source driver. Enter a database display name and the JDBC Connection URL for your MySQL
instance.

The JDBC connection URL should look like this:

```yaml {4-6}
jdbc:mysql://<hostname>:<port>/<database name>?user=<username>&password=<password>
```

For example:

```yaml {4-6}
jdbc:mysql://myhost.mycompany.com/mysqltest?user=abc&password=pqr  # assuming the default port 3306
jdbc:mysql://localhost:4533/mysqltest?user=abc&password=pqr        # assuming MySQL is running on port 4533

```

For more information see
[MySQL Connection URL syntax](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-j/8.0/en/connector-j-reference-jdbc-url-format.html).

Click `Connect Database`.

### Step 7: Track tables and run GraphQL API queries

Now that you have successfully connected your MySQL database to Hasura, you can track tables and use Hasura to
automatically build a GraphQL API on top of it.
