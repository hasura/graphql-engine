### `v2.0.9-pro.1`

#### Support for null values in boolean expressions

In v2, we introduced a breaking change, that aimed at fixing a
[long-standing issue](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/issues/704>) a null value in a boolean expression would
always evaluate to `True` for all rows. For example, the following queries were all equivalent:

```
delete_users(where: {\_id: {\_eq: null}}) # field is null, which is as if it were omitted
delete_users(where: {\_id: {}}) # object is empty, evaluates to True for all rows
delete_users(where: {}) # object is empty, evaluates to True for all rows
delete_users() # delete all users
```

This behaviour was unintuitive, and could be an unpleasant surprise for users that expected the first query to mean
"delete all users for whom the id column is null". Therefore in v2, we changed the implementation of boolean operators
to reject null values, as we deemed it safer:

```
delete_users(where: {\_id: {\_eq: null}}) # error: argument of \_eq cannot be null
```

However, this change broke the workflows of [some of our users](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/issues/6660)
who were relying on this property of boolean operators. This was used, for instance, to _conditionally_ enable a test:

{{< highlight graphql >}} query($isVerified: Boolean) { users(where: {\_isVerified: {\_eq: $isVerified}}) { name } }
{{< / highlight >}}

We now support the use of the functions `ST_3DDWithin` and `ST_3DIntersects` in boolean expressions. Note that
`ST_3DIntersects` requires PostGIS be
[built with SFCGAL support](https://www.postgis.net/docs/manual-3.1/reference.html#reference_sfcgal) which may depend on
the PostGIS distribution used.

- Server: Format the values of `injectEventContext` as hexadecimal string instead of integer (fix #6465)
- Server: All `/query` APIs now require admin privileges
- Miscellaneous fixes

### `v2.0.1-pro.1`

Includes everything from OSS `v2.0.0-alpha.1` through
[v2.0.0-alpha.6](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/releases)

#### Breaking changes

This version includes breaking changes from previous version (i.e `v1.3.3-pro.x`).

- **Multiple mutations in same request are not transactional**

UPDATE (since v2.0.9-pro.1): For only Postgres data source, multiple fields in a mutation will be run in one transaction
to preserve backwards compatibility

- **Semantics of explicit "null" values in "where" filters have changed**

  According to the discussion in [issue 704](https://github.
  xcom/hasura/graphql-engine/issues/704#issuecomment-635571407), an explicit `null` value in a comparison input object
  will be treated as an error rather than resulting in the expression being evaluated to `True`.

  For example: The mutation `delete_users(where: {id: {_eq: $userId}}) { name }` will yield an error if `$userId` is
  `null` instead of deleting all users.

  _UPDATE (since v2.0.9-pro.1)_: The old behaviour can be enabled by setting an environment variable:
  `HASURA_GRAPHQL_V1_BOOLEAN_NULL_COLLAPSE: true`.

- **Semantics of "null" join values in remote schema relationships have changed**

  In a remote schema relationship query, the remote schema will be queried when all of the joining arguments are not
  `null` values. When there are `null` value(s), the remote schema won't be queried and the response of the remote
  relationship field will be `null`. Earlier, the remote schema was queried with the `null` value arguments and the
  response depended upon how the remote schema handled the `null` arguments but as per user feedback, this behaviour was
  clearly not expected.

- **Order of keys in objects passed as "order_by" operator inputs is not preserved**

  The `order_by` operator accepts an array of objects as input to allow ordering by multiple fields in a given order,
  i.e. `[{field1: sortOrder}, {field2: sortOrder}]` but it is also accepts a single object with multiple keys as an
  input, i.e. `{field1: sortOrder, field2: sortOrder}`. In earlier versions, Hasura's query parsing logic used to
  maintain the order of keys in the input object and hence the appropriate `order by` clauses with the fields in the
  right order were generated.

  As the [GraphQL spec](http://spec.graphql.org/June2018/#sec-Input-Object-Values) mentions that input object keys are
  unordered, Hasura v2.0's new and stricter query parsing logic doesn't maintain the order of keys in the input object
  taking away the guarantee of the generated `order by` clauses to have the fields in the given order.

  For example: The query `fetch_users(order_by: {age: desc, name: asc}) {id name age}` which is intended to fetch users
  ordered by their age and then by their name is now not guaranteed to return results first ordered by age and then by
  their name as the `order_by` input is passed as an object. To achieve the expected behaviour, the following query
  `fetch_users(order_by: [{age: desc}, {name: asc}]) {id name age}` should be used which uses an array to define the
  order of fields to generate the appropriate `order by` clause.

- **Incompatibility with older Hasura version remote schemas**

  With v2.0, some of the auto-generated schema types have been extended. For example, `String_comparison_exp` has an
  additional `regex` input object field. This means if you have a Hasura API with an older Hasura version added as a
  remote schema then it will have a type conflict. You should upgrade all Hasura remote schemas to avoid such type
  conflicts.

- **Migrations are not executed under a single transaction**

  While applying multiple migrations, in earlier Hasura CLI versions all migration files were run under one transaction
  block. i.e. if any migration threw an error, all the previously successfully executed migrations would be rolled back.
  With Hasura CLI v2.0, each migration file is run in its own transaction block but all the migrations are not executed
  under one. i.e. if any migration throws an error, applying further migrations will be stopped but the other
  successfully executed migrations up till that point will not be rolled back.
