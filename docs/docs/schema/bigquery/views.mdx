# BigQuery: Extend Schema with Views

## What are views?

[Views][] can be used to expose the results of a custom query as a virtual table. Views are not persisted physically
i.e. the query defining a view is executed whenever data is requested from the view.

Hasura GraphQL Engine lets you expose views over the GraphQL API to allow querying them using both `queries` and
`subscriptions` just like regular tables.

## Creating views {#bigquery-create-views}

<Tabs groupId="user-preference" className="api-tabs">
<TabItem value="console" label="Console">

Views can be created using SQL which can be run in the Hasura Console:

- Head to the `Data -> SQL` section of the Hasura Console
- Enter your [create view SQL statement][views]
- Hit the `Run` button

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

1.  [Create a migration manually](/migrations-metadata-seeds/manage-migrations.mdx#create-manual-migrations) and add
    your [create view SQL statement][views] to the `up.sql` file. Also, add an SQL statement to the `down.sql` file that
    reverts the previous statement.

2.  Apply the Migration and Metadata by running:

    ```bash
    hasura migrate apply
    ```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="api" label="API">

You can add a view by using the `bigquery_run_sql` schema API:

```http
POST /v2/query HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
X-Hasura-Role: admin

{
  "type": "bigquery_run_sql",
  "args": {
    "source": "<db_name>",
    "sql": "<create view statement>"
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Tracking views

Views can be present in the underlying BigQuery database without being exposed over the GraphQL API. In order to expose
a view over the GraphQL API, it needs to be **tracked**.

<Tabs groupId="user-preference" className="api-tabs">
<TabItem value="console" label="Console">

While creating views from the `Data -> SQL` page, selecting the `Track this` checkbox will expose the new view over the
GraphQL API right after creation.

You can track any existing views in your database from the `Data -> Schema` page:

<Thumbnail src="/img/schema/schema-track-views.png" alt="Track views" />

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

1.  To track the view and expose it over the GraphQL API, edit the `tables.yaml` file in the `metadata` directory as
    follows:

    ```yaml {7-9}
    - table:
        dataset: my_data
        name: author
    - table:
        dataset: my_data
        name: article
    - table:
        dataset: my_data
        name: <name of view>
    ```

2.  Apply the Metadata by running:

    ```bash
    hasura metadata apply
    ```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="api" label="API">

To track the view and expose it over the GraphQL API, make the following API call to the
[bigquery_track_table](/api-reference/metadata-api/table-view.mdx#metadata-bigquery-track-table) Metadata API:

```http
POST /v1/metadata HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
X-Hasura-Role: admin

{
  "type":"bigquery_track_table",
  "args": {
    "source": "<db_name>",
    "dataset": "my_data",
    "name": "<name of view>"
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Use cases

Views are ideal solutions for retrieving some derived data based on some custom business logic.

Let's look at a few example use cases for views:

### Example: Group by and then aggregate

Sometimes we might want to fetch some data derived by aggregating (avg, min, max, etc.) over a group of rows in a table.

Letâ€™s say we want to fetch the average article rating for each author in the following schema:

```sql
my_data.author(id integer, name string, city string, email string, phone string, address string)

my_data.article(id integer, title string, content string, rating integer, author_id integer)
```

A view that averages the rating of articles for each author can be created using the following SQL query:

```sql
CREATE VIEW my_data.author_average_rating AS (
  SELECT author_id, avg(rating) avg_rating
    FROM my_data.article
    GROUP BY author_id
)
```

### Example: Hide certain fields of a table

Sometimes we might have some sensitive information in a table which we wouldn't want to expose.

Let's say, we want to expose the following `author` table without the fields `email`, `phone` and `address`:

```sql
author(id integer, name string, city string, email string, phone string, address string)
```

A view that only exposes the non-sensitive fields of the `author` table can be created using the following SQL query:

```sql
CREATE VIEW my_data.author_public AS (
  SELECT id, name, city
    FROM author
)
```
