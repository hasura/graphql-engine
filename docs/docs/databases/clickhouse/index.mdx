# ClickHouse

## Introduction

Hasura supports connecting to a [Clickhouse](https://www.clickhouse.com) service to automatically build a GraphQL API
based on its schema.

:::tip Supported versions:

1.  Hasura GraphQL Engine `v2.30.0` onwards

:::

## Get Started

To try Hasura with ClickHouse, you'll need a new or existing ClickHouse instance.

Here are 2 ways you can get started with Hasura and ClickHouse:

1.  [Hasura Cloud](/databases/clickhouse/getting-started/cloud.mdx): You'll need to be able to access your ClickHouse
    instance service from Hasura Cloud.
2.  [Docker](/databases/clickhouse/getting-started/docker.mdx): Run Hasura with Docker and then connect your ClickHouse
    instance to Hasura.

## Managing data with the Hasura Console

The Hasura Console is a web UI that allows you to manage your data and metadata. It is available at
`http://localhost:8080/console` when you run Hasura locally, or from your project's Console endpoint when you use
[Hasura Cloud](https://cloud.hasura.io).

The data-management features (such as creating tables) are available in the `Data` tab. You can access your GraphQL API
in the `API` tab and interact with it using the GraphiQL interface.

:::info Console support

We recommend using your preferred ClickHouse client instead. The Hasura Console is designed to be a tool for managing
your GraphQL API, and not a full-fledged database management tool.

## Keep up to date

:::info Note

Currently, Hasura supports read-only queries, subscriptions, relationships, and permissions on ClickHouse.
