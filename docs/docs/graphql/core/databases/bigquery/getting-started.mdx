# Getting started with BigQuery

## Run Hasura GraphQL engine

### Using Hasura Cloud

Navigate to
[cloud.hasura.io](https://cloud.hasura.io/signup/?pg=docs&plcmt=body&cta=navigate-to-cloud-hasura-io&tech=default),
and create a new Hasura Cloud account.

Once you create a project on Hasura Cloud, hit the "Launch Console"
button to open the Hasura Console for your project.

### Using docker

Get the Hasura docker-compose file:

```bash
# in a new directory run
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hasura/graphql-engine/stable/install-manifests/docker-compose/docker-compose.yaml
# or run
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hasura/graphql-engine/stable/install-manifests/docker-compose/docker-compose.yaml -o docker-compose.yaml
```

The following command will run Hasura along with a Postgres database
required for its functioning.

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
```

Check if the containers are running:

```bash
$ docker ps

CONTAINER ID IMAGE                 ... CREATED STATUS PORTS          ...
097f58433a2b hasura/graphql-engine ... 1m ago  Up 1m  8080->8080/tcp ...
b0b1aac0508d postgres              ... 1m ago  Up 1m  5432/tcp       ...

Please do note that you will see a Postgres database running, which is used by Hasura to store its configuration (Hasura metadata).
```

Head to `http://localhost:8080/console` to open the Hasura console.

## Connecting to a BigQuery project

### Pre-requisites

Hasura GraphQL engine requires the following to connect to a BigQuery
project:

- [Project Id](https://support.google.com/googleapi/answer/7014113?hl=en)
- The [datasets](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/datasets-intro)
  that can be exposed over graphql have to be explicitly listed.
- A [Service Account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts) to
  query the project.

### Creating a Service Account

- In Google Cloud's console, head to your BigQuery project.

- Go to `IAM & Admin > Service Accounts > Create Service Account`

    alt="Add source"

  />

- Give it a name, and under roles, and grant these 3 roles:
  `BigQuery Metadata Viewer`, `BigQuery Data Viewer` and
  `BigQuery Job User`.

    alt="Add source"
    width="600px"
  />

- Click on the created service account,
  `Keys > ADD KEY > Create New Key > JSON > Create`. This will
  download a service account file on your computer.

### Connect BigQuery to Hasura

- Update Graphql engine with an environment variable set to the
  contents of the service account.

For example, this maybe done as follows if you are using docker:

```bash
docker run -e BIGQUERY_SA_ACCOUNT=$(cat /path/to/the/service-account.json) <rest-of-the-flags>
```

- Head to the console, in the `Connect Existing Database` page, choose
  `Environment Variable` under `Connect Via`, and fill in the
  necessary details:

  <Thumbnail
    src="/img/graphql/core/databases/bigquery/3-connect-bigquery.png"
    alt="Add source"
    width="600px"
  />

You should now be able to track the tables that are part of the
specified tables and configure relationships between them. As BigQuery
lacks foreign key constraints, the console cannot suggest relationships,
so all relationships between BigQuery tables have to be manually
configured.

## Try out a GraphQL query

Head to the `GraphiQL` tab in the console and try running a GraphQL
query! Use the explorer sidebar on GraphQL to get help in creating a
GraphQL query.

## Keep up to date

Hasura currently supports queries on BigQuery.

Please watch this space to get the latest docs on how you can try these
features out via the console or by manipulating metadata in JSON/YAML
directly.
