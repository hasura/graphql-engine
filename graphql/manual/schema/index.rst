Schema
======

Hasura GraphQL engine automatically generates your GraphQL schema and resolvers once you create tables or views
in Postgres. **You don't need to write a GraphQL schema, you don't need to write resolvers.**

The Hasura console gives you UI tools that speed up your data-modelling process or working with your existing database.
The console also automatically generates migrations or metadata files that you can edit directly and check into your
version control.

Hasura GraphQL engine lets you do anything you would usually do with Postgres by giving you GraphQL over native
Postgres constructs.
