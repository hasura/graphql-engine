# Metrics via Prometheus

<div className="badge badge--primary heading-badge">Available on: Self-hosted Enterprise</div>

## Enable metrics endpoint

By default the Prometheus metrics endpoint is disabled. To enable Prometheus metrics, configure the environment variable
below:

```bash
HASURA_GRAPHQL_ENABLED_APIS=metadata,graphql,config,metrics
```

Secure the Prometheus metrics endpoint with a secret:

```bash
HASURA_GRAPHQL_METRICS_SECRET=<secret>
```

```bash
curl 'http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/metrics' -H 'Authorization: Bearer <secret>'
```

:::note Note

- The metrics endpoint should be configured with a secret to prevent misuse and should not be exposed over the internet.

:::note Note

The GraphQL request execution time:

- Uses wall-clock time, so it includes time spent waiting on I/O.
- Includes authorization, parsing, validation, planning, and execution (calls to databases, Remote Schemas).
