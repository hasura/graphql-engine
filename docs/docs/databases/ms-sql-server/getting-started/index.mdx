# Get Started with MS SQL Server

To try Hasura with SQL Server, you'll need your own new or existing SQL Server database.

Here are 2 ways you can get started with Hasura:

1.  [Hasura Cloud](/databases/ms-sql-server/getting-started/cloud.mdx) : You'll need to be able to access your SQL Server database from Hasura Cloud.
2.  [Docker](/databases/ms-sql-server/getting-started/docker.mdx): Run Hasura with Docker and then connect your SQL Server database to Hasura.
