# Product Badges

For any feature that isn't available across all products, you can add a badge to the product page to highlight the
feature. The badge looks like this:

<ProductBadge ce free />

The badge accepts a series of props - as boolean - that correspond to the products that the feature is available on. The
order of the props doesn't matter, but the props themselves are:

| Prop       | Product                  |
| ---------- | ------------------------ |
| `ce`       | Community Edition        |
| `free`     | Cloud Free               |
| `standard` | Cloud Standard           |
| `pro`      | Cloud Professional       |
| `ee`       | Cloud Enterprise Edition |
| `self`     | Self-Hosted EE           |

To create the example referenced above, you would start by importing the component near the markdown file's frontmatter:

```jsx
import ProductBadge from '@site/src/components/ProductBadge';
```

Then, add the component to the file immediately after the page's title (`<h1 />`):

```jsx
<ProductBadge ce free />
```
