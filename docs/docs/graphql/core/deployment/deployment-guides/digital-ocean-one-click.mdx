# Hasura GraphQL engine One-click App on DigitalOcean Marketplace

## Introduction

The Hasura GraphQL engine is available as a One-click app on the
DigitalOcean Marketplace. It is packed with a
[Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) database and
[Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) webserver for easy and automatic HTTPS
using [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).

## Deploying Hasura on Digital Ocean

### Step 1: Create a Hasura One-click Droplet

Click the button below to create a new Hasura GraphQL engine Droplet
through the DigitalOcean Marketplace. For first time users, the link
also contains a referral code with gives you $100 over days. A $5
droplet is good enough to support most workloads. (`Ctrl+Click` to open
in a new tab)

### Step 2: Open console

Once the Hasura GraphQL engine Droplet is ready, you can visit the
Droplet IP to open the Hasura console, where you can create tables,
explore GraphQL APIs etc. Note that it might take 1 or 2 minutes for
everything to start running.

The `Droplet IP` is highlighted in the image below:

  alt="Dashboard for digital ocean droplet"
/>

The Hasura console will be at:

```bash
http://<your_droplet_ip>/console
```

The GraphQL endpoint will be:

```bash
http://<your_droplet_ip>/v1/graphql
```

A Postgres database is also provisioned on the Droplet. Using the
console, you can create a table on this Postgres instance and make your
first GraphQL query.

### Step 3: Create a table

Navigate to `Data -> Add table` on the console and create a table called
`profile` with the following columns:

`profile`

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th width="50%">column name</th>
<th width="50%">type</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>id</code></td>
<td>Integer (auto-increment)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>name</code></td>
<td>Text</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Choose `id` as the Primary key and click the `Add Table` button.

### Step 4: Insert sample data

Once the table is created, go to the `Insert Row` tab and insert some
sample rows:

```bash
Thor
Iron Man
Hulk
Captain America
Black Widow
```

/>

### Step 5: Try out GraphQL

Switch to the `API` tab on top and execute the following GraphQL
query:

```graphql
query {
  profile {
    id
    name
  }
}
```

## Securing the GraphQL endpoint {#digital-ocean-secure}

By default Hasura is exposed without any admin secret. Anyone can read
and write to your database using GraphQL. When deploying to production,
you should secure the endpoint by adding an admin secret key and then
setting up permission rules on tables.

To add an admin secret key, follow the steps described below:

### Step 1: Connect to the Droplet via SSH

```bash
ssh root@<your_droplet_ip>
```

### Step 2: Go to the `/etc/hasura` directory

```bash
cd /etc/hasura
```

### Step 3: Set an admin secret

Edit `docker-compose.yaml` and un-comment the line that mentions admin
secret key. Also change it to some unique secret:

```bash
vim docker-compose.yaml

...
# un-comment next line to add an admin secret key
HASURA_GRAPHQL_ADMIN_SECRET: <myadminsecretkey>
...

# type ESC followed by :wq to save and quit
```

### Step 4: Update the container

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

That's it. Visit the console at `http://<your_droplet_ip>/console` and
it should prompt for the admin secret key. Further API requests can be
made by adding the following header:

```bash
X-Hasura-Admin-Secret: <myadminsecretkey>
```

## Adding a domain & enabling HTTPS

If you own a domain, you can enable HTTPS on this Droplet by mapping the
domain to the Droplet's IP. The Hasura GraphQL Droplet is configured
with Caddy which is an HTTP/2 web server with automatic HTTPS using
Let's Encrypt.

### Step 1: Add a record mapping

Go to your domain's DNS dashboard and add an A record mapping the domain
to the Droplet IP.

### Step 2: Connect to the Droplet via SSH

```bash
ssh root@<your_droplet_ip>
```

### Step 3: Go to the `/etc/hasura` directory

```bash
cd /etc/hasura
```

### Step 4: Edit the `Caddyfile` and change `:80` to your domain

```bash
vim Caddyfile

...

 https://you.domain.example.com {
  reverse_proxy * graphql-engine:8080 {
      header_up Host {http.request.host}
      header_up X-Real-IP {http.request.remote}
      header_up X-Forwarded-For {http.request.remote}
      header_up X-Forwarded-Port {http.request.port}
      header_up X-Forwarded-Proto {http.request.scheme}
  }
}
...

# type ESC followed by :wq to save and quit
```

### Step 5: Restart the container

```bash
docker-compose restart caddy
```

Go to `https://<your_domain>/console` to visit the Hasura console.

## Updating to the latest version {#do-updating}

When a new version of the GraphQL engine is released, you can upgrade to
it by just changing the version tag in `docker-compose.yaml`. You can
find the latest releases on the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/releases).

### Step 1: Connect to the Droplet via SSH

```bash
ssh root@<your_droplet_ip>
```

### Step 2: Go to the `/etc/hasura` directory

```bash
cd /etc/hasura
```

### Step 3: Edit `docker-compose.yaml` and change the image tag to the latest one

```bash
vim docker-compose.yaml

...
graphql-engine:
   image: hasura/graphql-engine:latest_tag_here
...

# type ESC followed by :wq to save and quit
```

### Step 4: Restart the container

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## Using DigitalOcean Managed Postgres Database {#do-managed-pg-db}

### Step 1: Create a Postgres database

Create a new Postgres database from the DigitalOcean console, preferably
in the same region as the Droplet.

### Step 2: Get the database URL

Once the database is created, under the "Overview" tab, from the
"Connection Details" section, choose "Connection string" from the
dropdown. "Connection string" is the "Database URL". Copy it.

### Step 3: Connect to the Droplet via SSH

```bash
ssh root@<your_droplet_ip>
```

### Step 4: Go to the `/etc/hasura` directory

```bash
cd /etc/hasura
```

### Step 5: Edit `docker-compose.yaml` and change the database URL

```bash
vim docker-compose.yaml

...
# change the url to use a different database
HASURA_GRAPHQL_DATABASE_URL: <database-url>
...

# type ESC followed by :wq to save and quit
```

Similarly, the database URL can be changed to connect to any other
Postgres database.

:::info Note

If you're using Hasura with a restricted database user, make sure you go
through [Postgres permissions](/graphql/core/deployment/postgres-requirements.mdx#postgres-permissions) to configure all
required permissions (not applicable with the default connection string
with DO Managed Postgres).

:::

#### Connection pooling

Connection pooling is a built-in feature of graphql-engine. The default
connection pool size is 50. If you need to configure the pool size or
the timeout, you can use the below environment variables.

-   `HASURA_GRAPHQL_PG_CONNECTIONS`: Maximum number of Postgres
    connections that can be opened per stripe (default: 50).
-   `HASURA_GRAPHQL_PG_TIMEOUT`: Each connection’s idle time before it
    is closed (default: 180 sec)

:::info Note

If you still want to enable connection pooling on your managed database
on DigitalOcean, you should do so in the `session` mode.

:::

## Access database via psql {#digital-ocean-connect-psql}

To access the Postgres database via `psql`, you can use the following
command via the terminal:

```bash
docker exec -it hasura_postgres_1 psql -U postgres
```

If you are using a hosted database
[as outlined above](#do-managed-pg-db), it's a little different:

```bash
docker exec -it hasura_postgres_1 psql -h <your database url> -p <your port> -d <your database> -U <your database user>
```

:::info Note

Different hosted Postgres providers may have different requirements for
connection, e.g. setting `sslmode`. Please refer to your provider's
documentation for generating the proper `psql` command flags.

## Logs {#do-logs}

### Step 1: Connect to the Droplet via SSH

```bash
ssh root@<your_droplet_ip>
```

### Step 2: Go to the `/etc/hasura` directory

```bash
cd /etc/hasura
```

### Step 3: Check logs

To checks logs for any container, use the following command:

```bash
docker-compose logs <container_name>
```

Where `<container_name>` is one of `graphql-engine`, `postgres` or
`caddy`.

## Troubleshooting

Logs should be able to help you in most scenarios. If it doesn't, feel free to talk to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/hasura).
