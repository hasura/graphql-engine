# Observability Best Practices

The purpose of this document is to provide an overview of some of the best practices to follow when you configure observability for your Hasura-driven product. The document covers the fundamentals of observability and provides general recommendations on what Hasura considers as observability best practices. While specifics of your product or system will define your configurations, we have used Hasura Cloud, Postgres, and Datadog to build this guide. Wherever applicable, links are provided to the mentioned product’s documentation. A sample dashboard based on Datadog is provided for you to replicate.

## The basics

### What is observability?

The ability to gauge a system's internal conditions by looking at its outputs is known as observability. If the current state of a system can be determined solely from information from outputs, such as sensor data, then the system is said to be "observable.”

Without observability, it would be challenging to figure out what is wrong with the system unless you were actively monitoring the system for issues. Observability means you can:

- Gain insights into the functionality and health of your systems, collect data, visualize them, and set up alerts for potential problems.
- Have distributed tracing provide end-to-end visibility into actual requests and code, helping you to improve the performance of your application.
- Audit, debug, and analyze - at scale - logs from all your services, apps, and platforms. 

### Three pillars of observability

The three pillars of observability are logs, metrics, and traces. Access to logs, metrics, and traces does not automatically make systems more visible. But in combination, they are potent tools that, when properly understood, allow the creation of observable systems.

## Observability in Hasura

### Hasura Cloud

Hasura Cloud projects include dashboards for observability. You will find your monitoring dashboard under the `Monitoring` tab of your Hasura cloud project.

The following default observability options are enabled on your cloud project:

- [Stats Overview](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/observability/overview/)
- [Errors](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/observability/errors/)
- [Usage Summaries](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/observability/usage/)
- [Operations](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/observability/operations/)
- [Websockets](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/observability/websockets/)
- [Subscription Workers](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/observability/subscription-workers/)
- [Distributed Tracing](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/observability/tracing/)
- [Query Tags](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/observability/query-tags/)

#### Third-party observability platforms

If your organization has multiple applications and systems that need to be monitored, the most efficient way to do so is via an observability platform. Hasura provides first-party integrations with multiple observability platforms and is fully open-telemetry compliant. You can find a list of third-party observability platforms supported by Hasura [here](/observability/integrations/index.mdx).

### Hasura Enterprise (self-hosted)

Since your Hasura Enterprise is self-hosted (on-premises or on a third-party cloud), we recommend that you enable monitoring for your containers and pods. Your organization can make better decisions by knowing what is happening at the cluster or host level and within the container runtime and application. This level of information allows you to make decisions like when to scale in or out instances, tasks, and pods, as well as the instance types to use.

#### Logs
Depending on your Hasura Enterprise Edition deployment mode, you may access, export, and process logs from your deployment using [this](/deployment/logging.mdx#log-types) document. Generally, you should configure your container logs to be exported to your observability platform using the appropriate log-drivers. 


#### Metrics via Prometheus integration
You can export metrics of your Hasura Cloud project to Prometheus. You can configure this on the `Integrations` tab on the project's settings page. You can find more information on how to integrate Prometheus into your Hasura project [here](/enterprise/metrics.mdx). This page also provides information about different metrics exported from Hasura to your Prometheus installation.

## Database observability

Deeper insight into databases across all of your servers is provided via database monitoring. To understand the performance and health of your databases and address problems as they develop, we have to dig deeper into: 

- Historical query performance
- Host-level metrics

### Enabling observability agents in your database

You can enable observability for your databases by installing an agent for your observability platform on your database servers (typically from the observability tool’s marketplace). Hasura recommends the following instrumentations should be implemented:

- System information
  - CPU Usage
  - Memory
- Query Tags

[Query Tags](/observability/query-tags.mdx) are SQL comments that consist of `key=value` pairs that are appended to generated SQL statements. When you issue a query or mutation with query tags, the generated SQL has some extra information. Database analytics tools can use the additional information (metadata) in these comments to analyze DB load and track/monitor performance.

### Using Query Tags and pganalyze

- Refer to documentation from [pganalyze](https://pganalyze.com/docs) for information on how to connect your database to the analyzer.
- Once connected to your database, test the functionality by:
  - Executing the `run console` option in pganalyze.
  - Executing the `collector --test` command in the console.
- At this point, all queries run from the GraphiQL editor or your Cloud project's console will appear in the pganalyze console.
- Selecting any query from the dashboard will expand to give additional information about the execution.
- To quickly locate operations, you can use the `Request ID` that can be found from the `Metrics` dashboard on Cloud.


## Alerting and alert propagation

Integrating your observability tools with an incident response platform (IRP) is the recommended method for alert propagation. Integrating with an IRP allows high visibility and actionable intelligence across the entire incident lifecycle. Most IRPs enable your organization to respond quickly to incidents, automate responses, and will allow you to build more reliable services and platforms.
