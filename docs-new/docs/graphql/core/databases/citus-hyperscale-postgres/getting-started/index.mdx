# Getting started with Citus - Hyperscale

To try Hasura with Citus, you'll need your own new or existing Citus database.

Here are 2 ways you can get started with Hasura:

1.  [Hasura Cloud](/graphql/core/databases/citus-hyperscale-postgres/getting-started/cloud.mdx): You'll need to be
    able to access your Citus database from Hasura Cloud.
2.  [Docker](/graphql/core/databases/citus-hyperscale-postgres/getting-started/docker.mdx): Run Hasura with Docker
    and then connect your Citus database to Hasura.
