  When a role has a permission defined in the metadata and is also an inherited one i.e. it defines parent roles, then the permission defined in the metadata takes precedence over the inherited permission. The
  `non_paying_user` is an example of such a case, where the role defines a permission on the `authors` table but not on the `articles` table.
