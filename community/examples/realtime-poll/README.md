# hasura-realtime-poll

A demo application to showcase real-time capabilities of [Hasura GraphQL
Engine](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine).

The Realtime Poll application is built using React and is powered by Hasura
GraphQL Engine over Postgres. It has an interface for users to cast vote on a
poll and the results are updated in the on-screen bar chart, in real-time.

The application makes use of Hasura GraphQL Engine's real-time capabilities
using `subscription`. There is no backend code involved. The application is
hosted on GitHub pages and the Postgres+GraphQL Engine is running on Postgres.

- Checkout the [live app](https://realtime-poll.demo.hasura.app/).
- Explore the backend using [Hasura
  Console](https://realtime-poll.demo.hasura.app/console).

  ```yaml
  endpoint: https://random-string-123.herokuapp.com
  ```
- Apply the migrations:
  ```bash
  hasura migrate apply
  ```
- Edit `HASURA_GRAPHQL_ENGINE_HOSTNAME` in `src/apollo.js` and set it to the
  Heroku app URL:
  ```js
  export const HASURA_GRAPHQL_ENGINE_HOSTNAME = 'random-string-123.herokuapp.com';
  ```
