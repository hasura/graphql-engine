# Plans and Pricing

<ProductBadge free pro ee />

## Introduction

[Hasura Cloud](https://cloud.hasura.io) offers three plans: Hasura Cloud Free, Hasura Cloud Professional, and Hasura
Cloud Enterprise.

Hasura Cloud billing is based on the consumption of resources. For paid plans, you can either pay as you go monthly in
arrears with the Cloud Professional Plan, or make an annual commitment with an upfront payment for the usage with the
Cloud Enterprise Plan.

Below, you'll find a guide to help you choose the right plan for your use case, an overview of each plan, and details on
how we calculate billing. Check out our [pricing FAQ](https://hasura.io/pricing#faq) for common questions.

## Choose the right plan

To help you choose the right plan for your use case, this section describes the application types and use cases that are
best suited for each plan. For a full feature comparison list, see the [pricing page](https://hasura.io/pricing). To

## Billing calculations for Hasura Cloud Professional {#billing-calculations}

For Hasura Cloud Professional we calculate billing, using the following categories, per Project:

- Types of databases connected to the Project
- Data passthrough

Hasura Cloud Professional is billed for the number of hours each Project runs and the amount of data passthrough. The
price depends on the type(s) of database(s) connected to the Project. If a Project uses a generic Postgres database and
a premium database, **you are billed only once for a premium database no matter how many or how different types you
add**.

| Database Type      | Rate            |
| ------------------ | --------------- |
| Generic Postgres   | $1.50/active-hr |
| Snowflake          | $3.00/active-hr |
| BigQuery           | $3.00/active-hr |
| Athena             | $3.00/active-hr |
| MSSQL              | $3.00/active-hr |
| CockroachDB        | $3.00/active-hr |
| Google AlloyDB     | $3.00/active-hr |
| Citus / Hyperscale | $3.00/active-hr |
| MySQL              | $3.00/active-hr |
| Oracle             | $3.00/active-hr |
| MariaDB            | $3.00/active-hr |

:::info Active-hr

An hour is considered an active hour when an activity is attributed to a Project during that hour. A few examples of
activity are:

- any GraphQL, REST, Metadata API request
- an active subscription
- an open websocket connection
- an event-triggered activity

:::

:::info Projects without databases

A Project without a connected database is billed at $1.50/active-hr.

#### Data passthrough

Hasura Cloud meters data passing through it to external services, including request data that is sent to upstream
services (e.g., databases) and response data sent to downstream services (e.g., web apps) at a rate of $0.13/GB.

You will be billed based on this volume of data which passes through your Project on Hasura Cloud every month.

#### Example Calculation

Assuming thirty days in the month, you start with one Project with a Postgres data connector for the first twenty days
of the Project and add Snowflake data connector for the remaining 10 days.

Assuming your Project is active for 8 hrs a day

`20 days * 8 hrs/day * $1.50/hr = $240`

`10 days * 8 hrs/day * $3.00/hr = $240`

Let's assume the data passthrough for the entire month is 100 GB:

`100 GB * $0.13/GB = $13 Total`

The total cost for the month is $493.
