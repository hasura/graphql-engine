## Switching pricing plans

### Switch from **Free** to **Professional** tier

Once the `Free` tier data limit is exhausted, the project becomes inactive. In order to keep it active, you can switch
to the `Professional` plan.

Go to `Projects` and click on the project you'd like to change.

Now click on the `Usage tab`. To upgrade to the `Professional` plan, click on the `Upgrade` button:

Your project is now running on the `Professional` plan.

### Switch from **Professional** to **Free** tier

Go to `Projects` and click on the project you'd like to change.

Under the `General` tab, find the `Pricing tier` section and click on the edit icon on the right:

You'll be charged as per the `Professional` plan until the end of the day. From the next day onwards, the project will
be on the `Free` tier. If the `Free` tier limit is exhausted, the project might become inactive.

### Switch to and from **Enterprise** tier

In order to upgrade to the `Enterprise` plan or to switch back to another plan, please
[contact our sales team](https://hasura.io/contact-us/?type=hasuraenterprise).
