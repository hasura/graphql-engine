## Join Discord for Support
We have a Discord Channel for those who are new to GraphQL. Please post your queries or feedback regarding this course. It is a pretty active channel.

Here's the [invite link](https://discordapp.com/invite/vBPpJkS) to join discord.

## More sample apps
We have a bunch of sample apps created using Angular, Apollo Client and Hasura GraphQL Engine.

Check out the [sample apps](https://hasura.io/sample-apps) to get a taste of how realtime GraphQL and Auth work with Hasura. We also have boilerplates to help you get started quickly with Angular and Apollo.
