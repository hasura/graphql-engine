# Quickstart RESTified Endpoints

RESTified endpoints allow you to quickly and easily create REST endpoints without writing custom code. This quickstart
will walk you through the process of creating a REST endpoint from a table.

To see an alternative method of creating a REST endpoint from an query in the GraphiQL IDE, check out the
[Create RESTified endpoints](/restified/create.mdx#create-from-graphiql) page.

:::info Data source availability

Available for **Postgres, MS SQL Server, Citus, AlloyDB and CockroachDB** databases.

### Step 1: Navigate to the products table.

Navigate to `Data > default > public > products` and click the "Create REST Endpoints" button.

### Step 2: Choose operations

After clicking on the "Create REST endpoints" button, you will see a modal list of all REST operations (`READ`, `READ
 ALL`, `CREATE`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`) available on the table. Select `READ` and `CREATE` for this demo. Click the
"Create" button.

### Step 3: View all REST endpoints

You will be able to see the newly created REST endpoints listed in the `API > REST` tab.

### Step 4: Test the REST endpoint

Click on the `products_by_pk` title to get to the details page for that RESTified endpoint. In the "Request
Variables" section for `id` enter the value `7992fdfa-65b5-11ed-8612-6a8b11ef7372`, the UUID for one of the products
already in the `products` table of the docs sample app. Click "Run Request".

/>

You will see the result returned next to the query.

You can test the other `insert_products_one` endpoint that we created in the same way by providing a new product
object as the request variable.

You can also use your favourite REST client to test the endpoint. For example, using `curl`:

```bash
curl --location --request GET 'https://<your-hasura-project>.hasura.app/api/rest/products/7992fdfa-65b5-11ed-8612-6a8b11ef7372' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'x-hasura-admin-secret: <your-admin-secret>'
```

## Recap

What just happened? Well, you just created two REST endpoints for reading a single product and inserting a product, 
super fast, and without writing a single line of code 🎉

This saves you significant time and effort, as you easily enable REST endpoints on your tables or [convert any query
or mutation into a REST endpoint](/restified/create.mdx) with just a few clicks.

By using RESTified endpoints, you can take advantage of the benefits of both REST and GraphQL, making your Hasura
project even more versatile and powerful. For more details, check out the
[configuration page](/restified/restified-config.mdx).
