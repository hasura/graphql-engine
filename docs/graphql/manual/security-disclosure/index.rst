This page describes the Hasura security vulnerability reporting and disclosure process.

Security announcements
----------------------

Join the `Hasura Security Announcements <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/hasura-security-announce>`_ group for emails about security announcements.

Reporting vulnerabilities
-------------------------

We’re extremely grateful for security researchers and users that report vulnerabilities to the Hasura community. All reports are thoroughly investigated by the project's maintainers.

To report a security issue, please email us at build@hasura.io with all the details, attaching all necessary information.

When should I report a vulnerability?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- You think you have discovered a potential security vulnerability in the Hasura GraphQL engine or related components.
- You are unsure how a vulnerability affects the Hasura GraphQL engine.
- You think you discovered a vulnerability in another project that Hasura GraphQL engine depends on (e.g. Heroku, Docker, etc).
- You want to report any other security risk that could potentially harm Hasura GraphQL engine users.

When should I NOT report a vulnerability?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- You need help tuning Hasura GraphQL engine components for security.
- You need help applying security related updates.
- Your issue is not security related.

Vulnerability report response
-----------------------------

Each vulnerability report is acknowledged and analyzed by the project’s maintainers within 3 working days.

The reporter will be kept updated at every stage of the issue’s analysis and resolution (triage -> fix -> release).

Vulnerability public disclosure timing
--------------------------------------

A public disclosure date in case a vulnerability is discovered is negotiated by the Hasura team and the bug submitter.

We prefer to fully disclose the vulnerability as soon as possible once a user mitigation is available.
It is reasonable to delay disclosure when the vulnerability or the fix is not yet fully understood, the solution is not well-tested, or for vendor coordination.
The time frame for disclosure is from immediate (especially if it’s already publicly known) to a few weeks.
Though, we expect the time frame between a report to a public disclosure to typically be in the order of 7 days.

The Hasura GraphQL engine maintainers will take the final call on setting a disclosure date.
