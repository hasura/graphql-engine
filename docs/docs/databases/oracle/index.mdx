## Introduction

Hasura enables you to connect to Oracle databases to automatically build a GraphQL API based on your database schema.

At present, our Oracle integration is available in Hasura Cloud and Docker environments, where you can run Hasura
GraphQL Engine and connect the Oracle GraphQL Data Connector to it. For more information on GraphQL Data Connectors
check out [our blog post on the topic](https://hasura.io/blog/hasura-graphql-data-connectors/).

To get started with Oracle:

- In Hasura Cloud, check out our [Getting Started with Oracle in Hasura Cloud](/databases/oracle/cloud.mdx) guide
- In a Docker environment, check out our [Getting Started with Docker](/databases/oracle/docker.mdx) guide

:::tip Supported versions

1.  Hasura GraphQL Engine `v2.23.0` onwards
2.  Oracle version 18.0 and higher

:::

:::tip Alpha version supported features

Hasura currently supports queries, mutations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE), table relationships, remote relationships and
permissions on Oracle.

Note that Hasura doesn't yet support the ability to modify the database schema for Oracle, so the database you connect
to should already contain tables and data. You should also ideally have access to it outside of Hasura to modify the
schema.
