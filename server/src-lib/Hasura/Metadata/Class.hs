{- Note [Todo: Common interface for eventing sub-system]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Postgres tables' event triggers and scheduled event triggers are similar in the
core logic. But currently, their implementation is completely isolated and do not
share a common schema in Postgres. We're having a plan to simplify them via a
common 'event storage and retrieval' interface (maybe via a Postgres extension?).
This will potentially reduce number of interactions made to database and schema foot print.

TODO: Reference to open issue or rfc?

-- | Metadata storage abstraction via a type class.
--
-- This type class enables storing and managing Hasura metadata in an isolated
-- database which will not interfere with user's database where tables/functions
-- are defined. Hence, it'll enable support for databases of multiple backends
-- like MySQL, MSSQL etc.
--
-- This class has functions broadly related to:
--
-- 1. Metadata Management (TODO: Need to be added to the type class)
-- ----------------------
-- Basic metadata management functions such as retrieving metadata from storage
-- database and replacing the given metadata.
--
-- 2. Scheduled Triggers
-- ---------------------
-- Eventing sub-system for scheduled triggers is implemented via metadata storage.
-- For more details, refer description in 'Hasura.Eventing.ScheduledTrigger' module.
--
-- TODO: Functions need to be added to the type class
-- - Retrieving invocation logs from storage (console requirement)
-- - Deleting an scheduled event
-- - Creating an one-off scheduled event
--
-- 3. Async Actions (TODO: Need to be added to the type class)
-- ----------------
-- Operations to implement async actions sub-system. This includes recording an
-- async action event and retreiving the details of action delivery to the webhook.
-- For more details see Note [Async action architecture] in 'Hasura.GraphQL.Execute.Action' module.
--
-- It is believed that all the above three are implemented in a single storage
-- system (ex: a Postgres database). We can split the functions into appropriate and
-- specific type classes in future iterations if required.

  -- scheduled/cron triggers and instead have functions that provide a generic
  -- 'event storage and retrieval' interface but we'll have to change a lot of
  -- existing code for scheduled and cron triggers. We can get to this after the
  -- multi-source work is done. See Note [Todo: Common interface for eventing sub-system]
