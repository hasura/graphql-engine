In this part of the tutorial, you will learn how to bulk delete all the existing completed todos by using GraphQL Mutations.

Let's define a graphql query to do a mutation into todos.

```graphql
mutation clearCompleted {
  delete_todos(where: {is_completed: {_eq: true}, is_public: {_eq: false}}) {
    affected_rows
  }
}
```

You will also need to pass in the values for the variables.

[Try this mutation in GraphiQL](https://learn.hasura.io/graphql/graphiql) against the application database to see what the response looks like.

Let's now integrate this graphql mutation into our react app.
