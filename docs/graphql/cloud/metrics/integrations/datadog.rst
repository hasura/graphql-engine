Introduction
------------

You can export metrics and operation logs of your Hasura Cloud project to your organisation's Datadog dashboard. This can be configured 
on the integrations tab on the project's setting page.

  Datadog Integration is only available for Hasura Cloud projects on the Standard (pay-as-you-go) tier.

Select the Datadog API region and enter the Datadog API key (can be retrieved by navigating to Datadog's settings page by clicking the ``Get API Key`` link), host, service name and tags to associate with exported logs. A source tag 
``hasura-cloud-metrics`` is added to all exported logs.

After adding appropriate values, click ``Save``. 

Checking the status of the integration
--------------------------------------

The green/red dot signifies the status of the integration. Green signifies successful exporting of logs to datadog. 
When logs are successfully exported, ``Last Exported`` is continuously updated, indicating the timestamp of the last log line successfully exported to your Datadog dashboard.

To view only logs exported by Hasura Cloud, filter your logs using ``host`` and/or ``tags`` you configured with this integration.

.. note::

  Datadog allows ingestion of logs with maximum size 256kB for a single log. If a log exceeds this limit, Datadog
  will truncate the log at 256kB.

View metrics
------------

The integration exports the following five metrics to your Datadog dashboard:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 30 30

   * - Metric Exported
     - Metric Name in Datadog

   * - Average number of requests
     - ``average_requests_per_minute``
  
   * - Average request execution time 
     - ``average_execution_time``

   * - Success rate of requests 
     - ``success_rate``

   * - Active subscriptions 
     - ``active_subscriptions``

   * - Number of websockets open
     - ``websockets_open``

Non zero values of all the above metrics are exported over a one minute time interval. Each metric name 
is prefixed with your project's name.

Graphs for all the above metrics can be viewed in your Datadog dashboard, under the ``Metrics`` tab. To navigate to the same, click ``View Metrics``.

graphs corresponding to metrics exported by Hasura Cloud.
