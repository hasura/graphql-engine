# Hasura GraphQL Engine Changelog

## Next release

### Remote Joins

Remote Joins extend the concept of joining data across tables, to being able to join data across tables and remote schemas.

It works similar to table relationships. Head to the `Relationship` tab in your table page and define a remote relationship:

1. give a name for the relationship
2. select the remote schema
3. give the join configuration from table columns to remote schema fields.

### Scheduled Triggers

A scheduled trigger can be used to execute custom business logic based on time. There are two types of timing events: cron based or timestamp based.

A cron trigger will be useful when something needs to be done periodically. For example, you can create a cron trigger to generate an end-of-day sales report every weekday at 9pm.

You can also schedule one-off events based on a timestamp. For example, a new scheduled event can be created for 2 weeks from when a user signs up to send them an email about their experience.

### Allow access to session variables by computed fields (fix #3846)

Sometimes it is useful for computed fields to have access to the Hasura session variables directly. For example, suppose you want to fetch some articles but also get related user info, say `likedByMe`. Now, you can define a function like:

```
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION article_liked(article_row article, hasura_session json)
RETURNS boolean AS $$
  SELECT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM liked_article A
    WHERE A.user_id = hasura_session ->> 'x-hasura-user-id' AND A.article_id = article_row.id
  );
$$ LANGUAGE sql STABLE;
```

and make a query like:

```
query {
  articles {
    title
    content
    likedByMe
  }
}
```

Support for this is now added through the `add_computed_field` API.

Read more about the session argument for computed fields in the [docs](https://hasura.io/docs/1.0/graphql/manual/api-reference/schema-metadata-api/computed-field.html).

## `v1.2.0`

Include the changelog from **v1.2.0-beta.1**, **v1.2.0-beta.2**, **v1.2.0-beta.3**, **v1.2.0-beta.4**, **v1.2.0-beta.5**

Additional changelog:

### CLI: Support servers with self-signed certificates (close #4564) (#4582)

A new flag `--certificate-authority` is added so that the CA certificate can be
provided to trust the Hasura Endpoint with a self-signed SSL certificate.

Another flag `--insecure-skip-tls-verification` is added to skip verifying the certificate
in case you don't have access to the CA certificate. As the name suggests,
using this flag is insecure since verification is not carried out.

## `v1.2.0-beta.5`

### server: backend only insert permissions

Introduces optional `backend_only` (default: `false`) configuration in insert permissions
(see [api reference](https://deploy-preview-4224--hasura-docs.netlify.com/graphql/manual/api-reference/schema-metadata-api/permission.html#insertpermission)).
If this is set to `true`, the insert mutation is accessible to the role only if the request
is accompanied by `x-hasura-use-backend-only-permissions` session variable whose value is set to `true` along with the `x-hasura-admin-secret` header.
Otherwise, the behavior of the permission remains unchanged.

This feature is highly useful in disabling `insert_table` mutation for a role from frontend clients while still being able to access it from a Action webhook handler (with the same role).

(rfc #4120) (#4224)

### server: debugging mode for non-admin roles

For any errors the server sends extra information in `extensions` field under `internal` key. Till now this was only
available for `admin` role requests. To enable this for other roles, start the server with `--dev-mode` flag or set `HASURA_GRAPHQL_DEV_MODE` env variable to `true`:

```bash
$ graphql-engine --database-url <database-url> serve --dev-mode
```

In case you want to disable `internal` field for `admin` role requests, set `--admin-internal-errors` option to `false` or or set `HASURA_GRAPHQL_ADMIN_INTERNAL_ERRORS` env variable to `false`

```bash
$ graphql-engine --database-url <database-url> serve --admin-internal-errors false
```

This feature come in handy during development when you may want to see detailed errors irrespective of roles.

**Improved internal errors for Actions**:

(This is a **breaking change** with previous 1.2.0-beta releases)

The `internal` field for action errors is improved with more debug information. It now includes `request`,
`response` and `error` fields instead of just `webhook_response` field.

Before:

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "extensions": {
        "internal": {
          "webhook_response": {
            "age": 25,
            "name": "Alice",
            "id": "some-id"
          }
        },
        "path": "$",
        "code": "unexpected"
      },
      "message": "unexpected fields in webhook response: age"
    }
  ]
}
```

After:

```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "extensions": {
        "internal": {
          "error": "unexpected response",
          "response": {
            "status": 200,
            "body": {
              "age": 25,
              "name": "Alice",
              "id": "some-id"
            },
            "headers": [
              {
                "value": "application/json",
                "name": "Content-Type"
              },
              {
                "value": "abcd",
                "name": "Set-Cookie"
              }
            ]
          },
          "request": {
            "body": {
              "session_variables": {
                "x-hasura-role": "admin"
              },
              "input": {
                "arg": {
                  "age": 25,
                  "name": "Alice",
                  "id": "some-id"
                }
              },
              "action": {
                "name": "mirror"
              }
            },
            "url": "http://127.0.0.1:5593/mirror-action",
            "headers": []
          }
        },
        "path": "$",
        "code": "unexpected"
      },
      "message": "unexpected fields in webhook response: age"
    }
  ]
}
```

### cli: add support for .env file

ENV vars can now be read from .env file present at the project root directory. A global flag, `--envfile`, is added so you can explicitly provide the .env filename, which defaults to `.env` filename if no flag is provided.

**Example**:

```
hasura console --envfile production.env
```

The above command will read ENV vars from `production.env` file present at the project root directory.

(close #4129) (#4454)

### console: allow setting post-update check in update permissions

Along with the check for filtering rows that can be updated, you can now set a post-update permission check that needs to be satisfied by the updated rows after the update is made.

<add-screenshot>

(close #4142) (#4313)

### console: support for Postgres [materialized views](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/rules-materializedviews.html)

Postgres materialized views are views that are persisted in a table-like form. They are now supported in the Hasura Console, in the same way as views. They will appear on the 'Schema' page, under the 'Data' tab, in the 'Untracked tables or views' section.

(close #91) (#4270)

### docs: map Postgres operators to corresponding Hasura operators

Map Postgres operators to corresponding Hasura operators at various places in docs and link to PG documentation for reference.
For example, see [here](https://hasura.io/docs/1.0/graphql/manual/api-reference/schema-metadata-api/syntax-defs.html#operator).

## `v1.2.0-beta.3`

### console: manage Postgres check constraints

Postgres Check constraints allows you to specify that the value in a certain column must satisfy a Boolean (truth-value) expression. They can be used to put in simple input validations for mutations and with this release, these constraints can now be added while creating a table or later from Modify tab on the console.

**Example**:
When a product is created, ensure that the price is greater than zero. The SQL would look like this:

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
    product_id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    name TEXT,
    price NUMERIC CONSTRAINT positive_price CHECK (price > 0)
);
```

To create this table with Hasura Console, on the 'Add a new table' screen, after adding all the columns, scroll down to 'Check constraints' section and 'Add a new check constraint' with the following properties:

- Constraint name: `positive_price`
- Check expression: `price > 0`

Read more about check constraints on [Postgres Docs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/ddl-constraints.html#DDL-CONSTRAINTS-CHECK-CONSTRAINTS).

(close #1700) (#3881)

### CLI: V2 migrations architecture

A new CLI migrations image is introduced to account for the new migrations workflow. If you're have a project with `version: 2` in `config.yaml`, you should use the new image: `hasura/graphql-engine:v1.2.0-cli-migrations-v2`. Mount the migrations at `/hasura-migrations` and metadata at `/hasura-metadata`.

See [upgrade docs](https://hasura.io/docs/1.0/graphql/manual/migrations/upgrade-v2.html).

## `v1.2.0-beta.1`

### Hasura Actions

Actions are a way to extend Hasura’s auto-generated mutations with entirely custom ones which can handle various use cases such as data validation, data enrichment from external sources and any other complex business logic.

A new mutation can be created either by defining its GraphQL SDL or by deriving it from an existing Hasura-generated mutation. The resolver is exposed to Hasura as a webhook which can be called synchronously or asynchronously. This release also includes an ever evolving codegen workflow to make managing the custom resolvers easier.

Read more about actions in the [docs](https://docs.hasura.io/1.0/graphql/manual/actions/index.html).

(#3042) (#3252) (#3859)

### Downgrade command

A new command is added to the server executable for downgrading to earlier releases. Previously, if you ran a newer Hasura version and wanted to go back to an old version on the same database, you had to stop Hasura, run some SQL statements and start Hasura again. With the new `downgrade` command, these SQL statements can be run automatically.

**Example**: Downgrade from `v1.2.0` to `v1.0.0`:

```bash
# stop hasura v1.2.0

# run the following command:
docker run hasura/graphql-engine:v1.2.0 graphql-engine --database-url <db-url> downgrade --to-v1.0.0

# start hasura v1.0.0
```

Read more about this command in the [docs](https://hasura.io/docs/1.0/graphql/manual/deployment/downgrading.html#downgrading-hasura-graphql-engine).

(close #1156) (#3760)

### Expiration of connections authenticated by WebHooks

When using webhooks to authenticate incoming requests to the GraphQL engine server, it is now possible to specify an expiration time; the connection to the server will be automatically closed if it's still running when the expiration delay is expired.

Read more about it in the [docs](https://hasura.io/docs/1.0/graphql/manual/auth/authentication/webhook.html).
