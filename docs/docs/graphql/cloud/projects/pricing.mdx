## Switching pricing plans

### Switch from **Free** to **Standard** tier

Once the `Free` tier data limit is exhausted, the project becomes
inactive. In order to keep it active, you can switch to the `Standard`
plan.

Go to `Projects` and click on the project you'd like to change.

Now click on the `Usage tab`. To upgrade to the `Standard` plan, click
on the `Upgrade` button:

  alt="Upgrade to the Standard plan"
  width="1200px"
/>

Your project is now running on the `Standard` plan.

### Switch from **Standard** to **Free** tier

Go to `Projects` and click on the project you'd like to change.

Under the `General` tab, find the `Pricing tier` section and click on the edit icon on the right:

<Thumbnail

  alt="Switch from Standard to Free tier"
  width="1200px"
/>

You'll be charged as per the `Standard` plan until the end of the day.
From the next day onwards, the project will be on the `Free` tier. If
the `Free` tier limit is exhausted, the project might become inactive.

### Switch to and from **Enterprise** tier

In order to upgrade to the `Enterprise` plan or to switch back to
another plan, please [contact our sales
team](https://hasura.io/contact-us/?type=hasuraenterprise).
