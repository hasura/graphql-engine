This course is a concise and powerful introduction to GraphQL for Elm developers.

Weâ€™ve structured this course to cover fundamental concepts of both GraphQL and using GraphQL in Elm, in the shortest amount of time possible. The course is light on opinions so that once you grok the fundamentals you can go on to choose your favourite tools and tailor your workflow.

## Key topics and takeways:

- GraphQL vs REST
- GraphQL queries, mutations, subscriptions
- Generating GraphQL types using elm-graphql (https://github.com/dillonkearns/elm-graphql/)
- Integrating GraphQL queries in your elm app
- Integrating GraphQL mutations with query variables to handle form input
- Setting up a GraphQL client with Apollo
- Integrating subscriptions using apollo-client on the javascript and ports on the elm
- Building a real-time feed with notifications using mutations and subscriptions

## What will we be building?
We will be building a realtime todo app using authenticated GraphQL APIs.

Try this deployed version of the app to see what we'll be building:

## Will this course teach Elm concepts as well?
No, we will be simulating a scenario where we already have a
GraphQL API and the basic UI of a elm app built. Our task in this
scenario is to integrate the GraphQL APIs into our elm app to build
a complete and working app.

## What do I need to take this tutorial?
You need to have elm 0.19.0, npm/yarn & node 8+ installed.

## How long will this tutorial take?
Less than 2 hours
