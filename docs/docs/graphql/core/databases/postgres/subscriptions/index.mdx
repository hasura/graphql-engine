# Postgres: Subscriptions

## Introduction

A GraphQL subscription is essentially a query where the client receives
an update whenever the value of any field changes upstream.

Subscriptions are supported for all kinds of queries. All the concepts
of [queries](/graphql/core/databases/postgres/queries/index.mdx) hold true for subscriptions as well.

:::info Caveat

Hasura follows the [GraphQL spec](https://graphql.github.io/graphql-spec/June2018/#sec-Single-root-field)
which allows for only one root field in a subscription.

:::

## Types of subscriptions

### Live queries


A live query subscription will return the latest result of the query being made
and not necessarily all the individual events leading up to the result.
By default, updates are delivered to clients every **1 sec**.

See more details [here](/graphql/core/databases/postgres/subscriptions/livequery/index.mdx).

### Streaming subscriptions

A streaming subscription streams the response according to the cursor input
by the user. A streaming subscription is different from a live query as it sends individual rows
at a time and not the entire result set.

See more details [here](/graphql/core/databases/postgres/subscriptions/streaming/index.mdx).

### Live query vs Streaming subscriptions

Suppose we need to display the messages of a group chat on a page, this can be done either via
live queries or streaming subscriptions. Let's see how they can be used and how they differ from each other.

1. Using **live query**

   With live query, we'll make the following query:

   ```graphql

      subscription {
        messages (
          where: {group_id: 1},
          order_by: {created_at: asc}
        ) {
          id
          sender
          reciever
          content
          created_at
          edited_at
        }
      }
   ```

   The initial response for this subscription will be all the messages of the group. Let's say the initial
   response contained 100 messages. Now, if there is one more message sent to the group, then all 101 messages
   will be sent in a new response.


2. Using **streaming subscriptions**

   With streaming subscriptions, we'll make the following query:

   ```graphql

      subscription {
        messages_stream (
          where: {group_id: 1},
          cursor: {initial_value: {created_at: now}},
          batch_size: 10
        ) {
          id
          sender
          reciever
          content
          created_at
          edited_at
        }
      }
   ```

   Here, we'll start getting all messages of the group in batches given by ``batch_size`` with ``created_at``
   greater than ``now``.

   Following the example of the live query, if we have 100 messages corresponding to the group and only
   5 messages with ``created_at`` greater than the current value of the cursor maintained by the cursor, then
   we will get only the 5 messages.

## Communication protocol

Hasura GraphQL engine uses the [GraphQL over WebSocket Protocol](https://github.com/apollographql/subscriptions-transport-ws/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md)
by the [apollographql/subscriptions-transport-ws](https://github.com/apollographql/subscriptions-transport-ws)
library and the [GraphQL over WebSocket Protocol](https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-ws/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md)
by the [graphql-ws](https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-ws) library for
sending and receiving events. The GraphQL engine uses the
`Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` header to determine the communication protocol
that'll be used. By default, the GraphQL engine will use the
`apollographql/subscriptions-transport-ws` protocol.

:::info Setting headers for subscriptions with Apollo client

If you are using Apollo Client, headers can be passed to a subscription
by setting `connectionParams` while [creating the wsLink](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/subscriptions/#client-setup):

```js {6-8}
// Create a WebSocket link:
const wsLink = new WebSocketLink({
  uri: `<graphql-endpoint>`,
  options: {
    reconnect: true,
    connectionParams: {
      headers: {headers-object}
    }
  }
});
```

See [this](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/subscriptions/#authentication-over-websocket)
for more info on using `connectionParams`.

:::

## Cookies and WebSockets

The Hasura GraphQL engine will read cookies sent by the browser when
initiating a WebSocket connection. The browser will send the cookie only
if it is a secure cookie (`secure` flag in the cookie) and if the cookie
has a `HttpOnly` flag.

Hasura will read this cookie and use it as headers when resolving
authorization (i.e. when resolving the auth webhook).

### Cookies, WebSockets and CORS

As browsers don't enforce Same Origin Policy (SOP) for websockets, the
Hasura server enforces the CORS rules when accepting the websocket
connection.

It uses the provided CORS configuration (as per [Configure CORS](/graphql/core/deployment/graphql-engine-flags/config-examples.mdx#configure-cors)).

1.  When it is `*`, the cookie is read and the CORS check is not
    enforced.
2.  When there are explicit domains, the cookie will only be read if the
    request originates from one of the listed domains.
3.  If CORS is disabled, the default behaviour is that the cookie won't
    be read (because of potential security issues). To override the
    behaviour, you can use the flag `--ws-read-cookie` or the
    environment variable `HASURA_GRAPHQL_WS_READ_COOKIE`. See
    [GraphQL Engine server config reference](/graphql/core/deployment/graphql-engine-flags/reference.mdx) for the setting.
