# Manually moving Hasura Cloud v1.3 projects to Hasura v2.0

## Introduction

Hasura Cloud now creates new projects with Hasura `v2.0` by default. Due
to some underlying architectural changes in `v2.0`, existing projects
have not yet been upgraded to `v2.0`.

In the meanwhile it is possible to manually "move" your project to use
Hasura `v2.0`. You will lose any scheduled events and the history of
your processed events and async actions in the process though.

Do check the
[changelog](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/releases) first to
see what changes and features have been introduced.

## Move existing v1.3 project to a v2.0 project

As it is not possible to actually upgrade your `v1.3` project to `v2.0`,
you will have to essentially create a new Hasura project with `v2.0` and
connect it with your database with the same Hasura metadata as in the
previous project.

### Step 1: Export metadata from existing project

See [exporting metadata](/graphql/core/migrations/manage-metadata.mdx) to get a copy of the
current Hasura metadata on your project.

Do ensure no further changes are made to the Hasura metadata post this.

### Step 2: Create a v2.0 Cloud project

See `Step 1` of [creating projects](/graphql/cloud/projects/create.mdx) to create a new
Hasura Cloud `v2.0` project.

### Step 3: Connect your database with the name **default** to the new project

See `Step 2` of [creating projects](/graphql/cloud/projects/create.mdx) to connect your
existing database to the new project. Please ensure you set the database
name as `default`.

:::info Note

After connecting a database to a `v2.0` project it will not be usable
with a `v1.3` project. Hence it is recommended to stop your `v1.3`
project before doing this.

:::

### Step 4: Apply the exported metadata to the new project

See [applying metadata](/graphql/core/migrations/manage-metadata.mdx) to apply the earlier
exported metadata to the new project.

Your GraphQL API should now be regenerated as in the earlier `v1.3`
project.
