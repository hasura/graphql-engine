# BigQuery: Schema

The Hasura GraphQL engine automatically generates your GraphQL schema
and resolvers based on your tables/views in BigQuery. **You don't need
to write a GraphQL schema or resolvers.** See [How Hasura GraphQL engine works](/graphql/core/how-it-works/index.mdx#how-it-works) for more details.

The Hasura console gives you UI tools that speed up your data-modelling
process, or working with your existing database.

The Hasura GraphQL engine lets you do anything you would usually do with
BigQuery by giving you GraphQL over native BigQuery constructs.
