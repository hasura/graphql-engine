# BigQuery: Schema

The Hasura GraphQL Engine automatically generates your GraphQL schema and resolvers based on your tables/views in
BigQuery. **You don't need to write a GraphQL schema or resolvers.** See
[How Hasura GraphQL Engine works](/getting-started/how-it-works/index.mdx) for more details.

The Hasura Console gives you UI tools that speed up your data-modeling process, or working with your existing database.

The Hasura GraphQL Engine lets you do anything you would usually do with BigQuery by giving you GraphQL over native
BigQuery constructs.

**See:**

- [Table relationships](/schema/bigquery/table-relationships/index.mdx)
- [Customize auto-generated fields](/schema/bigquery/custom-field-names.mdx)
- [Computed fields](/schema/bigquery/computed-fields.mdx)
