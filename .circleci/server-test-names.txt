# This file lists the various test suites that can be run in order to fully
# exercise HGE server with the Python tests. They are split into suites based
# on how HGE needs to be started.
#
# To run them, the relevant name is passed to test-server.sh, which then starts
# HGE in the correct fashion and runs the appropriate tests.
#
# We *also* have a new way of running the Python tests, in which each test
# starts HGE with the appropriate configuration. This file is not used there, as
# we run all the tests at once.
#
# Some of the below test suites are commented out. These are the tests that
# are fully covered by the new style, and are therefore duplicated here.
