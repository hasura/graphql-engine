Switching pricing plans
-----------------------

Switch from **Free** to **Standard** tier
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once the ``Free`` tier data limit is exhausted, the project becomes inactive. In order to keep it active, you can switch to the ``Standard`` plan.

Go to ``Projects`` and click on the project you'd like to change.

Now click on the ``Usage tab``. To upgrade to the ``Standard`` plan, click on the ``Upgrade`` button:

   :class: inline-block

Your project is now running on the ``Standard`` plan.

Switch from **Standard** to **Free** tier
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Go to ``Projects`` and click on the project you'd like to change. 

Now click on the ``Usage`` tab and then click on the link ``Switch to the free tier`` on the bottom right:

.. thumbnail:: /img/graphql/cloud/projects/switch-to-free-plan.png

   :class: inline-block

You'll be charged as per the ``Standard`` plan until the end of the day. From the next day onwards, the project will be on the ``Free`` tier.
If the ``Free`` tier limit is exhausted, the project might become inactive.

Switch to and from **Enterprise** tier
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to upgrade to the ``Enterprise`` plan or to switch back to another plan, please `contact our sales team <https://hasura.io/contact-us/?type=hasuraenterprise>`__.
