# As this is a read-only test, we can't create the schema/tables as part of the
# HGE metadata. This setup assumes the tables are already created.
# The schema assumed is -
# CREATE TABLE aves (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT)
# And (already existing) data assumed is -
#  - id: 1
#    name: Booted Eagle
#  - id: 2
#    name: Hooded Merganser
