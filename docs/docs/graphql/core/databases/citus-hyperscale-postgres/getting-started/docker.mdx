# Get Started with Docker (Hasura & Citus - Hyperscale)

## Try it out

### Pre-requisites

-   [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
-   [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
-   An existing Citus database

### Step 1: Get the docker-compose file

Get the Hasura docker-compose file:

```bash
# in a new directory run
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hasura/graphql-engine/stable/install-manifests/docker-compose/docker-compose.yaml
# or run
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hasura/graphql-engine/stable/install-manifests/docker-compose/docker-compose.yaml -o docker-compose.yaml
```

### Step 2: Run Hasura GraphQL engine

The following command will run Hasura along with a Postgres database
required for its functioning.

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
```

Check if the containers are running:

```bash
$ docker ps

CONTAINER ID IMAGE                 ... CREATED STATUS PORTS          ...
097f58433a2b hasura/graphql-engine ... 1m ago  Up 1m  8080->8080/tcp ...
b0b1aac0508d postgres              ... 1m ago  Up 1m  5432/tcp       ...

Please do note that you will see a Postgres database running, which is used by Hasura to store its configuration (Hasura metadata).
```

### Step 3: Open the Hasura console

Head to `http://localhost:8080/console` to open the Hasura console.

### Step 4: Add your Citus database as a source to Hasura

In the `Data > Data Manager > Connect Existing Database` section on the
console, select `Citus` from the `Data Source Driver` dropdown and add
the connection string directly or through an environment variable. As
Citus speaks the same protocol as Postgres, the connection string will
start with `postgres://`, i.e, there is no difference between Citus’s
connection strings and Postgres’s connection strings.

If you're testing Hasura with Citus running locally, [read this guide](/graphql/core/guides/docker-networking.mdx) 
on Docker networking in case you're not sure how to make sure that your Citus database is reachable from the
Hasura docker container on Linux, Mac or Windows.

Once you add the database, you'll see your database pop up on the sidebar.

### Step 5: Track existing tables or create new tables

If you have existing tables, head to the database page by clicking on
the database name on the sidebar. You should see a list of tables.

-->

Track tables selectively or all of them so that Hasura can introspect
the tables and create the corresponding GraphQL schema.

-->

If you have foreign keys, you'll also see suggested relationships.
Again, you can choose to track them selectively or all at once.

-->

If you don't have existing tables, go ahead and add new tables and data
and try out some queries, just like with a regular Postgres database.

<!--

   Step 3: Option 2: Create new tables
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   If you don't have existing tables, head to the Run SQL window
   to run SQL against your SQL Server database and create tables or hit the Create Table button
   to create a table.

   If you're running raw SQL queries to create your tables, Don't forget to check "track metadata"
   at the bottom of the Run SQL window to make sure Hasura tracks your new database objects 
   in its GraphQL schema.

      :width: 1000px

### Step 6: Try out a GraphQL query

Head to the `API` tab in the console and try running a GraphQL
query! Use the explorer sidebar on GraphQL to get help in creating a
GraphQL query.

## Keep up to date

Hasura supports queries, subscriptions, relationships and permissions on Citus - Hyperscale.

Please watch this space to get the latest docs on how you can try these
features out via the console or by manipulating metadata in JSON/YAML directly.
