# Analytics

Here there is every analytics (Sentry, Heap, etc.) related info.

## Legend

### [Sentry](https://sentry.io/)

The tool of choice to

- Track uncaught JavaScript errors in the Console
- Track uncaught React errors in the Console
- Track errors sent back by the server
- Track custom events as errors (or warnings or logs, see `programmaticallyTraceError`)

it can be enabled through the `HASURA_CONSOLE_SENTRY_DSN` environment variable. At the time of writing, Hasura enables it only for the Cloud Console.

### [Heap](https://heap.io/)

The tool of choice to

- Track the usage of the Console's features
- Create funnels out of it
- Identify if features that include heavy legacy code or dependencies can be removed

## The `<Analytics />` component

`<Analytics />` is the central reference for everything analytics related. It covers 99% of the use cases, but the `@features/Analytics` module also exposes the underlying `useGetAnalyticsAttributes` and `getAnalyticsAttributes`. Where to use them? Well

|                                                                                                                                           | `<Analytics />`                                   | `useGetAnalyticsAttributes` | `getAnalyticsAttributes` |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Do you need to add the HTML attributes to DOM elements?                                                                                   | ✅                                                |                             |                          |
| Do you need to add the HTML attributes to React components?                                                                               | ✅                                                |                             |                          |
| The same as above, but by passing the HTML attributes as props instead of wrapping the React component into a `display:contents` div?     | ✅ (with the `passHtmlAttributesToChildren` prop) |                             |                          |
| Do you need to add the HTML attributes to DOM elements that cannot be wrapped in React components? (ex. the `title` tag passed to Helmet) |                                                   | ✅                          |                          |
| The same as above, but in a React class component?                                                                                        |                                                   |                             | ✅                       |
| Do you wou want to embed the analytics features in a common component? (please consider decoupling the two functionalities, BTW)          | ✅                                                |                             |                          |
| Tha same as above, but the analytics features are optional? (conditinally rendering the `<Analytics />` component could be cumbersome)    |                                                   | ✅                          |                          |

Following, a list of features `<Analytics />` unleashes.

### data-analytics-name

The custom `data-analytics-name` attributes are helpful for

1. Easing creating funnels by grouping related elements: creating funnels out of the displayed texts scales better, but, for instance, a button showing the text "Create" could be hard to be identified because the string "Create" could be present multiple times on the page. Instead, if the section containing the button has a `data-analytics-name="create-new-db"`, identifying the "Create" button becomes easier
2. Tracking elements whose contents are redacted because include sensitive data. Think about the database sidebar tree. All the items in the tree expose sensitive data but having the schema-related buttons with `data-analytics-name="sidebar-db-schewma"` and `data-analytics-name="sidebar-db-table"` allow tracking the clicks on them without leaking the database names

The `<Analytics />` component centralize adding the `data-analytics-name` attribute (enforced through an ESLint rule).

Please note: previously, we used the `data-trackid` attribute. Now, we consider it legacy.

### Sensitive data

The `<Analytics />` have batteries included to redact their text or HTML attributes that leak sensitive data.

## The plan

Currently

- All the sections of the Console redact everything for Heap (see the usage of `<Analytics />`)

What we have to do

- One by one, we must refactor every section to stop exposing sensitive data (see here [the complete list of exposed data](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bVXpz0p1k2os7lmvSuwDzQDUoYwGQ9thOyckcuI6Hgk))

## Custom events

Custom events are helpful to

- Track meaningful information about what the user is doing (e.g. "Disable the x-hasura-admin-secret key" instead of the standard "The user clicked on x-hasura-admin-secret" that is tracked automatically)
- Track interaction events for elements we do not control the rendered HTML (e.g. the GraphiQL component)
- Track interaction events for elements that are part of a parent that prevent Heap from tracing interaction events
- Track the server errors
- Track JavaScript-only information (e.g. the unexpected or outdated usage of a function)

Every time you add a custom event, think about what are the most suitable tool (even more than once) to track the event and copy/paste an existing tracing function instead of creating a new one with different patterns (look for the usage of the Analytics' `trackCustomEvent` function).
