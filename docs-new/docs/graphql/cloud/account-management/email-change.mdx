# Change email address on Hasura Cloud

## Introduction

You can edit the email address on your Hasura Cloud account to another email from the `Account Settings` page.

## Changing email for users logged in using email {#email-change}

On the `Account Settings` page, select the `Edit` button.

The invitee receives an email verification mail. Once the invitee clicks the link, it logs out the existing user and redirects the invitee to the Hasura Cloud login page.

The user can now log in to Hasura Cloud using the new email and the password for the old email.


## Changing email for users with social logins

If you logged in to Hasura Cloud with your social login, you must reset your password to initiate the email change process.
On the [Sign in](https://cloud.hasura.io/login?redirect_url=/) page, select `Forgot?`.

Next, enter the new email id and click **Recover Password**.
Set a new password by clicking on the reset password link sent to your email address.

You can now log in with the email and this new password and follow the steps mentioned in the [above section](#email-change) to change the email.

You can also use the social login associated with the new email to log in to Hasura Cloud!
