# Headings

* Headings should use `Title Capitalization Like This`.
* Subheadings, anything less than `h1` or markdown level 1: `#`, should use `Sentence capitalization like this`.
* Headings should not end with a period.
* Leave a blank line above and below headings.
* Add an introduction section as `## Introduction` with a short overview of what the page is about.
* Page titles should be self-sufficient. Users might not have the context of the hierarchy of the page in the docs tree.
  A user can land on a page via search as well. e.g. Say you are adding a new deployment guide for AWS under
  `Guides -> Deployment -> AWS`. The title of this page should not be just `AWS` but instead
  `AWS deployment guide for Hasura GraphQL engine`. It's ok to alias it to just `AWS` in the sidebar
  (`sidebar_label: AWS`) as there the user has the context of the page hierarchy.
