# Run Hasura GraphQL engine on Heroku

## Introduction

This guide shows how to deploy Hasura GraphQL engine on Heroku.

## Deploying Hasura with a new Postgres DB

<TOCInline toc={[...toc[1].children]} />

### Option 1: One-click deployment {#heroku-one-click}

Click the below button to deploy Hasura on Heroku in a few seconds:

[<img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/83b0e95b38892b49184e07ad572c94c8038323fb/68747470733a2f2f7777772e6865726f6b7563646e2e636f6d2f6465706c6f792f627574746f6e2e737667" class="no-shadow no-shadow" width="200" alt="heroku_deploy_button" />](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine-heroku)

:::info Note

If you don't have an account on Heroku, you need to sign up on Heroku.
You won't need a credit card, and once you sign up you'll be redirected
to your Heroku app creation page automatically.

Heroku's free Postgres add-on is automatically provisioned.

### Option 2: Deploy via Heroku CLI {#heroku-cli-deployment}

Follow these instructions to create a new Heroku app with a Postgres
add-on using the Heroku CLI.

#### Step 1: Clone the Hasura GraphQL engine Heroku app

The Hasura app with Heroku buildpack/configuration is available at:

[https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine-heroku](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine-heroku)

#### Step 2: Create an app with **--stack=container**

Use the [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli)
to create a new Heroku app from inside the cloned directory. Let's call
the app `todo-hasura1`.

```bash
# Replace todo-hasura1 with whatever you'd like your app to be called
$ heroku create todo-hasura1 --stack=container

Creating ⬢ todo-hasura1... done, stack is container
https://todo-hasura1.herokuapp.com/ | https://git.heroku.com/todo-hasura1.git
```

**Note**:

-   `HEROKU_GIT_REMOTE`: _https://git.heroku.com/todo-hasura1.git_
-   `HEROKU_APP_URL`: _https://todo-hasura1.herokuapp.com/_

#### Step 3: Create the Heroku Postgres add-on

Create the Postgres add-on in your Heroku app.

```bash
$ heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev -a todo-hasura1

Creating heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev on ⬢ todo-hasura1... free
Database has been created and is available
 ! This database is empty. If upgrading, you can transfer
  ! data from another database with pg:copy
  Created postgresql-angular-20334 as DATABASE_URL
  Use heroku addons:docs heroku-postgresql to view documentation
```

#### Step 4: **git push** to deploy

Remember to change `HEROKU_GIT_REMOTE` to your git remote below. In our
case: `https://git.heroku.com/todo-hasura1.git`.

```bash
$ git init && git add .
$ git commit -m "first commit"
$ git remote add heroku <HEROKU_GIT_REMOTE>
$ git push heroku master
```

Visit `https://todo-hasura1.herokuapp.com` (replace `todo-hasura1` with
your app name) and you should see the Hasura console.

## Deploying using an existing Postgres DB {#heroku-existing-db}

Let's say you have an existing [Heroku Postgres](https://www.heroku.com/postgres) database with data in it, and
you'd like to add GraphQL to it.

<TOCInline toc={[...toc[2].children]} />

:::info Note

As you're exposing an existing database, please
[configure an admin secret](#heroku-secure) to prevent public access of
the console and the GraphQL endpoint.

:::

### Option 1: Via Heroku UI

#### Step 1: Deploy Hasura on Heroku

Deploy Hasura on Heroku as described in
[this section](#heroku-one-click).

#### Step 2: Remove the created Postgres add-on in the app

Head to your Heroku dashboard and delete the Postgres add-on created in
the previous step:

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/graphql/core/deployment/delete-heroku-postgres-addon.png"
  alt="Delete the Postgres add-on"
/>

#### Step 3: Configure environment variables

Now configure the `DATABASE_URL` with your existing Heroku Postgres
database URL and a `HASURA_GRAPHQL_ADMIN_SECRET` if you want to
[secure your endpoint](#heroku-secure).

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/graphql/core/deployment/heroku-database-access-url.png"
  alt="Configure environment variables"
/>

:::info Note

The Hasura GraphQL engine needs access permissions to your Postgres
database as described in [Postgres permissions](/graphql/core/deployment/postgres-requirements.mdx#postgres-permissions).

:::

#### Step 4: Track tables and relationships

Wait for the GraphQL engine to restart and then see
[Setting up a GraphQL schema using an existing Postgres database](/graphql/core/databases/postgres/schema/using-existing-database.mdx) to enable GraphQL over the database.

### Option 2: Via Heroku CLI

You can set up the Hasura GraphQL engine as a "git push to deploy" app
on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/platform) and connect it to a [Heroku Postgres](https://www.heroku.com/postgres) instance.

#### Step 1: Clone the Hasura GraphQL engine Heroku app

The Hasura app with Heroku buildpack/configuration is available at:

[https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine-heroku](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine-heroku)

#### Step 2: Configure the database URL

Edit the command in the `Dockerfile` to change which database the Hasura
GraphQL engine connects to. By default, it connects to the primary
database in your app which is available at `DATABASE_URL`.

```dockerfile {6}
FROM hasura/graphql-engine:latest

# Change $DATABASE_URL to your Heroku Postgres URL if you're not using
# the primary Postgres instance in your app
CMD graphql-engine \
  --database-url $DATABASE_URL \
  serve \
  --server-port $PORT \
  --enable-console
```

Read about more configuration options [here](/graphql/core/deployment/graphql-engine-flags/reference.mdx).

:::info Note

Hasura GraphQL engine needs access permissions to your Postgres database
as described in [Postgres permissions](/graphql/core/deployment/postgres-requirements.mdx#postgres-permissions).

:::

## Securing the GraphQL endpoint {#heroku-secure}

To make sure that your GraphQL endpoint and the Hasura console are not
publicly accessible, you need to configure an admin secret key.

### Add an admin secret

Head to the config-vars URL on your Heroku dashboard and set the
`HASURA_GRAPHQL_ADMIN_SECRET` environment variable.

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/graphql/core/deployment/secure-heroku.png"
  alt="Add an admin secret"
/>

Setting this environment variable will automatically restart the dyno.
Now when you access your console, you'll be prompted for the admin
secret key.

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/graphql/core/deployment/access-key-console.png"
  alt="Prompt for the admin secret"
/>

:::info Note

The `HASURA_GRAPHQL_ADMIN_SECRET` should never be passed from the client
to Hasura GraphQL engine as it would give the client full admin rights
to your Hasura instance. See [Authentication & Authorization](/graphql/core/auth/index.mdx) for information on setting up
authentication.

:::

#### (optional) Use the admin secret with the CLI

In case you're using the CLI to open the Hasura console, use the
`admin-secret` flag when you open the console:

```bash
hasura console --admin-secret=myadminsecretkey
```

## GraphQL engine server logs {#heroku-logs}

You can use the [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli) to check the logs
of the Hasura GraphQL engine deployed on Heroku:

```bash
$ heroku logs --app <hasura-graphql-engine-app-name>

2018-10-09T11:18:21.306000+00:00 app[web.1]: {"timestamp":"2018-10-09T11:18:21.305+0000", "level":"info", "type":"http-log", "detail":{"status":200, "query_hash":"48c74f902b53a886f9ddc1b7dd12a4a6020d70c3", "http_version":"HTTP/1.1", "query_execution_time":9.477913e-3, "request_id":"b7bb6fb3-97b3-4c6f-a54a-1e0f71a190e9", "url":"/v1/graphql", "user":{"x-hasura-role":"admin"}, "ip":"171.61.77.16", "response_size":15290, "method":"POST", "detail":null}}
...
```

**See:**

-   [https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/logging](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/logging) for more details on
    logging on Heroku.
-   [Hasura GraphQL engine logs](/graphql/core/deployment/logging.mdx) for more details on Hasura logs

## Updating GraphQL engine {#heroku-update}

This section will help you update the Hasura GraphQL engine running on
Heroku.

The current latest version is:

```bash
hasura/graphql-engine:v1.3.3
```

### Update to the latest version

#### Step 1: Clone the Hasura GraphQL engine Heroku app

The Hasura app with Heroku buildpack/configuration is available at:
[https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine-heroku](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine-heroku).

Clone the above repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine-heroku
cd graphql-engine-heroku
```

If you already have this, then pull the latest changes which will have
the updated GraphQL engine Docker image.

#### Step 2: Attach your Heroku app

Let's say your Heroku app is called `hasura-heroku` and is running on
`https://hasura-heroku.herokuapp.com`.

From inside the `graphql-engine-heroku` directory, use the [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli) to configure the
git repo you cloned in Step 1 to be able to push to this app.

```bash
# Replace <hasura-heroku> with your Heroku app's name
heroku git:remote -a <hasura-heroku>
heroku stack:set container -a <hasura-heroku>
```

You can find your Heroku git repo in your Heroku - Settings - Info -
Heroku Git URL

#### Step 3: **git push** to deploy the latest Hasura GraphQL engine

When you `git push` to deploy, the Heroku app will get updated with the
latest changes:

```bash
git push heroku master
```

### Deploy a specific version

Head to the `Dockerfile` in the git repo you cloned in step 1. Change
the `FROM` line to the specific version you want. A list of all releases
can be found at [https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/releases](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/releases).

```Dockerfile {1}
FROM hasura/graphql-engine:v1.0.0

...
...
```

Change `v1.0.0` to `v1.1.0` for example, commit this and then
`git push heroku master` to deploy.

:::info Note

If you are downgrading to an older version of the GraphQL engine you
might need to downgrade your metadata catalogue version as described in
[Downgrading Hasura GraphQL engine](/graphql/core/deployment/downgrading.mdx)
