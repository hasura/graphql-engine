# Migrations & Metadata Setup

## Introduction

[Migrations and Metadata](/migrations-metadata-seeds/index.mdx) allow you to keep track of, update, roll-back or move your database
and Hasura Server configurations using the [Hasura CLI](/hasura-cli/index.mdx).


## Getting started

It is a typical requirement to export an existing Hasura "setup" so that you can apply it to another Hasura instance
to reproduce the same setup. For example, to achieve a **dev**️ -> **staging**️ -> **production** environment
promotion scenario.

:::info Note

You can also choose to manage your database migrations using external tools like: knex, TypeORM, Django/Rails
migrations, etc.

:::

Any change made in the Console served by Hasura CLI which modifies your underlying database schema can be kept
track of in Migrations.

Let's set up Migrations starting with the following two tables in our schema. For this guide we're assuming you have
a Hasura Server up and running, either on [Hasura Cloud](/getting-started/index.mdx) or as a
[standalone installation in Docker](/getting-started/index.mdx) and have connected a database with a table that has
some columns configured.


```sql
author (id uuid, name text, rating integer)
article (id uuid, title text, content text, author_id uuid)
```

## Step 0: Disable the Console served by the server {#migrations-project-init}

The Hasura Console can be served directly by the Hasura Server and also by the Hasura CLI. To use Migrations,
the console served by the server (which is served at `/console`) should be disabled and all changes must
go through the Console served by the CLI. Otherwise, changes could be made through the Server Console which _**will
not**_ be tracked by Migrations.

In order to disable the Server Console either remove the `--enable-console` flag from the command that starts the
server or set the following environment variable to `false`:

```bash
HASURA_GRAPHQL_ENABLE_CONSOLE=false
```

:::info Note

If you set this in YAML, make sure you use false as a string, i.e. `HASURA_GRAPHQL_ENABLE_CONSOLE: "false"`.

:::

## Step 1: Install the Hasura CLI

Follow the instructions in [Installing the Hasura CLI](/hasura-cli/install-hasura-cli.mdx).

## Step 2: Set up a project directory

Let's set up a project directory by executing the following command:

```bash
hasura init demo-project --endpoint https://docs-demo.hasura.app --admin-secret mySecret
```

Input `Y` or `Yes` at the prompt:
```text
? Initialize project with metadata & migrations from https://docs-demo.hasura.app ? Yes
```

We'll see an output like this:
```text
INFO Metadata exported
INFO Creating migrations for source: default
INFO Created Migrations
INFO migrations applied
INFO directory created. execute the following commands to continue:

  cd /Users/me/demo-project
  hasura console
```

Let's break all this down:

`hasura init` is the command to create a new Hasura directory structure in a new directory called `demo-project` which
we also specified. It will create a `config.yaml` file and a `migrations`, `metadata` and `seeds` directory. This
directory structure is mandatory and should not be changed in order to use Hasura migrations properly.

### Endpoint
We use the `--endpoint` flag to give the `init` command the URI location of our endpoint. Change this to your own
Hasura location. In this example we're using a Hasura Cloud instance but if you've deployed Hasura using Docker, the
URL might be `http://xx.xx.xx.xx:8080` without the `https` and with a port number. In either case, the endpoint should
_**not**_ contain the `/v1/graphql` API path. It should just be the hostname, and any sub-path if it is configured that
way.

### Admin Secret
If you have an admin secret set on your Server, you can set it safely as an environment variable
`HASURA_GRAPHQL_ADMIN_SECRET=<your-admin-secret>` on your local machine and the CLI will use it for running commands.
In our example though we added an `--admin-secret` flag and your admin secret value to the `init` command This will be
saved along with the specified endpoint in the `config.yaml` file. With this, we will also not have to add them as
flags for every subsequent Hasura CLI command.

:::warning Caution

Be mindful of adding `config.yaml` with an admin secret or other sensitive data to version control in case you
accidentally leak secrets of a public Hasura instance. To avoid this you can add sensitive values to an
environment variable file such as `production.env` with env vars in accordance with the
[Hasura CLI supported vars](/hasura-cli/config-reference.mdx) and then deleting the sensitive key-value line
from your `config.yaml` file. You can then specify using this file in the Hasura CLI with the `--envfile` flag.
Eg: `hasura console --envfile production.env`

:::

### Initialization
By inputting `Yes` at the prompt to initialize metadata & migrations we have told the CLI to create an initial
Migrations directory called, for example, `1654696186008_init`. This naming structure consists of a Unix timestamp
in nanoseconds of when it was created (the "version") and an auto generated name. Since this is the initialization
of Migrations the CLI automatically names it `init`.

Our directory structure should now look something like this:
```text
📂 demo-project
├─ 📂 metadata
│  ├─ 📂 databases
│  │  ├─ 📂 default
│  │  │  └─ 📂 tables
│  │  │     ├─ 📄 public_author.yaml
│  │  │     ├─ 📄 public_article.yaml
│  │  │     └─ 📄 tables.yaml
│  │  └── 📄 databases.yaml
│  ├─ 📄 actions.graphql
│  ├─ 📄 actions.yaml
│  ├─ 📄 allow_list.yaml
│  ├─ 📄 api_limits.yaml
│  ├─ 📄 cron_triggers.yaml
│  ├─ 📄 graphql_schema_introspection.yaml
│  ├─ 📄 inherited_roles.yaml
│  ├─ 📄 network.yaml
│  ├─ 📄 query_collections.yaml
│  ├─ 📄 remote_schemas.yaml
│  ├─ 📄 rest_endpoints.yaml
│  └─ 📄 version.yaml
├─ 📂 migrations
│  └─ 📂 default
│     └─ 📂 1654696186008_init
│        └─ 📄 up.sql
├─ 📂 seeds
└─ 📄 config.yaml
```

If we had entered `No` at the prompt, the Hasura Migrations and Metadata would not have been initialised, and you
would be able to do it manually [using the CLI later](/hasura-cli/commands/hasura_init.mdx).

As you can see from the structure, the `metadata` folder contains files used to describe the configuration of the
Hasura server and the `migrations` folder contains a folder for each of our databases. Ours only has one, `default`,
and within it we have our migration folder consisting of the up.sql file with the SQL commands needed to create our
database schema.

## Step 3: Add Migrations and Metadata to version control

The project directory created above can be committed to version control allowing us to keep our codebase and database
(and metadata) changes in-sync.

Set up Git version control and make the first commit:

```bash
# initialize version control
git init

# commit initial project status
git add .
git commit -m "hasura project init"
```

## Step 4: Use the console served by the CLI

From this point onwards, instead of using the console at `http://docs-demo.hasura.app/console` you should only use the
console served by the CLI in order to track Migration and Metadata changes. Do this by running:

```bash
# in project directory
hasura console
```

## Step 5: Add a new table and see how Migrations and Metadata are updated

As you use the Hasura Console UI served by the CLI to make changes to your schema, database migration files are
automatically generated in the `migrations/` directory and the metadata is exported in the `metadata/` directory of
your project.

Let's use the Console to create the following table `address (id uuid, street text, zip text, city text,
country text, author_id uuid)` and once that's done create a foreign-key to the `author` table via the `author_id ->
id` columns.

Now if we check the `migrations/<database-name>` directory, we can find new directories called
`<version-timestamp-number>_create_table_public_address` and
`<version-timestamp-number>_set_fk_public_address_author_id` containing an `up.sql` and a `down.sql` migration files
reflecting the changes we made to the database schema.

The `up.sql` file tells Hasura how to create the change we made and the `down.sql` tells Hasura how to roll back the
change.

:::warning Warning

The accuracy of `up.sql` files is guaranteed but you should manually check `down.sql` files in order to make sure
they accurately describe the opposite of the `up.sql` Migration.

:::

You can also go ahead and add some permissions or create relationships for the address table. The related metadata
changes will automatically be exported into the `metadata` directory.

:::info Note

Migrations are only created when using the console through the CLI.

:::

## Step 6: Squash Migrations and add checkpoints to version control

Squashing Migrations is the process of merging multiple `sql` files into one. As you keep using the console via the
CLI to make changes to the schema, new migration files will keep getting generated and the metadata files will keep
getting updated automatically.

Typically, while adding a feature, a lot of incremental migration files get created for each of the small tasks that
you did to achieve the feature.

To improve maintainability of the migration files and to ensure you can go back to a particular version of the
metadata, it is recommended that you periodically squash your migration files and commit the project status to
version control whenever you reach a logical checkpoint in your feature development.

The following command will squash all migration files from the given migration to the latest migration into a single
migration file.

```bash
hasura migrate squash --name "<my-feature-name>" --from <start-migration-version-timestamp-number> --database-name
<database-name>

# note down the version timestamp number
```

Because all the Migrations included in the squash have already happened on the Server, we need to tell the Server
that this new squashed version has already been applied. When we do this using the `hasura migrate apply` command
but also tell the Server not to execute the statements in the squash to avoid errors and conflicts. We do that as
follows:

```bash
# mark the squashed migration as applied on this server
hasura migrate apply --version "<squash-migration-version-timestamp-number>" --skip-execution --database-name <database-name>
```

Now we can commit the current project status into version control with our new feature.

```bash
# in project dir
git add .
git commit -m "<feature-name>"
```

## Step 7: Apply Migrations and Metadata on another instance of the Hasura Server

Let's apply all the Migrations present in the `migrations/` directory and the Metadata present in the `metadata/`
directory on a new, "fresh", instance of the Hasura Server at `http://another-server-instance.hasura.app`:

We can use the Hasura CLI command `deploy` to do this.

```bash
# in project dir
hasura deploy --endpoint http://another-server-instance.hasura.app
```

This command will apply Migrations and Metadata on the new Hasura instance and make sure that the Metadata is
consistent with the underlying database schema.

:::info Note
If you need an automated way of applying Migrations and Metadata, take a look at the
[cli-migrations](/migrations-metadata-seeds/auto-apply-migrations.mdx) Docker image, which can
automatically apply Migrations and Metadata and then start the Hasura Server.
:::

If you open the Console of the new instance, you can see that our three tables have been created and tracked:

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/graphql/core/migrations/tracked-tables.png"
  alt="Tracked tables from Hasura migrations"
  width="30%"
/>

## Step 8: Check the status of Migrations

Let's check the status of our Migrations using the CLI.
```bash
# in project dir
hasura migrate status
```

Hasura Migrations work on a per-database basis. So at the prompt, select your database or choose `All` to select all
databases. You can also add the flag `--database-name default` with your database name to the command to specify the
database and skip the prompt.

This command will print out each migration version present in the `migrations` directory along with its name, source
status and database status.

For example,

```bash
$ hasura migrate status --database-name default
VERSION        NAME                           SOURCE STATUS  DATABASE STATUS
1654696186008  init                           Present        Present
1654696713921  create_table_public_address    Present        Present
```

We can see the version timestamp number of the migration, it's name, and whether it's present in the source (our
filesystem) and also present on the database via the Hasura Server. Hasura keeps track of which migrations have been
applied to the databases in order to not duplicate applying them and creating errors.

If `SOURCE STATUS` indicates `Not Present`, it means that the migration version is present on the server, but not on
the current user's local directory. This typically happens if multiple people are collaborating on a project and one
of the collaborators forgot to pull the latest changes which included the latest migration files, or another
collaborator forgot to push the latest migration files that were applied on the database. Syncing of the files would
fix the issue.

If `DATABASE STATUS` indicates `Not Present`, it means that there are new migration versions in the local directory
which are not applied on the database yet. To apply them executing `hasura migrate apply` will resolve this.
