# Removing Event Triggers

## Removing an Event Trigger via metadata API

An Event Trigger can be removed using the following metadata API **only when the metadata is consistent with the
database**.

- **delete_event_trigger**: Refer to the
  [pg_delete_event_trigger](/api-reference/metadata-api/event-triggers.mdx#metadata-pg-delete-event-trigger) API to
  remove an Event Trigger in a Postgres source
- **untrack_table**: Refer to the
  [pg_untrack_table](/api-reference/metadata-api/table-view.mdx/#metadata-pg-untrack-table) API to untrack a table
  present in a Postgres source
- **drop_source**: Refer to the [pg_drop_source](/api-reference/metadata-api/source.mdx/#metadata-pg-drop-source) API to
  drop a Postgres source

The following metadata APIs can be used to remove an Event Trigger even with inconsistent metadata, although it may
leave a Hasura footprint in the database:

- **replace_metadata**: Refer to the
  [replace_metadata](/api-reference/metadata-api/manage-metadata.mdx/#metadata-replace-metadata) API to replace an
  existing metadata with new metadata
- **clear_metadata**: Refer to the
[clear_metadata](/api-reference/metadata-api/manage-metadata.mdx/#metadata-clear-metadata) to clear the metadata

Refer to the following sections on cleaning up Hasura footprints manually from the database.

## Clean up Event Trigger footprints manually

When an Event Trigger is created, Hasura creates SQL triggers on the table corresponding to each operation mentioned in
the Event Trigger configuration (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE). 

When an inconsistent Table/Event Trigger is removed via the `replace_metadata` API, it may leave orphaned SQL triggers
in the database. The following command can be used to manually delete SQL triggers corresponding to an Event Trigger on
a table:

```sql
DROP FUNCTION hdb_catalog."notify_hasura_<event-trigger-name>_<OPERATION-NAME>" CASCADE;
```

For example: to delete SQL triggers corresponding to an Event Trigger: `users_all` on a table: `users` with operation:
`INSERT` in the Event Trigger configuration:

```sql
DROP FUNCTION hdb_catalog."notify_hasura_users_all_INSERT" CASCADE;
```

:::info Note

The SQL trigger should be deleted for each operation mentioned in the Event Trigger configuration, i.e.
INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE

## Clean up Hasura footprints from a source manually {#clean-footprints-manually}

When an inconsistent source is dropped, it may leave Hasura footprint in the database due to Event Triggers. The
following can be used to remove all footprint of Event Triggers present in a source from the database:

### Case 1: When using a different metadata database from the source database

In this case, `hdb_metadata` table is not present in `hdb_catalog` schema of the source.

To clean up Hasura footprint completely, drop the `hdb_catalog` schema:

```sql
DROP SCHEMA IF EXISTS hdb_catalog;
```

### Case 2: When the metadata database and source database are the same

In this case, a `hdb_metadata` table is present in `hdb_catalog` schema of the source. You may want to preserve the
metadata but remove the remaining Hasura footprint of a few tables for Event Triggers and corresponding SQL triggers.

**Step 1:** In order to drop the SQL triggers corresponding to Event Triggers created, please refer to the [clean up
Event Trigger footprints manually](/event-triggers/remove-event-triggers.mdx/#clean-up-event-trigger-footprints-manually) section.
Alternatively, the following command can be used to drop all SQL triggers in the source:

```sql
do $$ 
declare f record; 
begin 
  for f in select trigger_name, event_object_table
    from information_schema.triggers
    where trigger_name like 'notify_hasura_%'
  loop 
    EXECUTE 'DROP FUNCTION hdb_catalog.' || QUOTE_IDENT(f.trigger_name) || ' CASCADE';
  end loop; 
end; 
$$;
```

**Step 2:** The following commands can be used to delete Event Triggers tables from `hdb_catalog`:

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS hdb_catalog.hdb_source_catalog_version;
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS hdb_catalog.insert_event_log(text, text, text, text, json);
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS hdb_catalog.event_invocation_logs;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS hdb_catalog.event_log;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS hdb_catalog.hdb_event_log_cleanups;
```

:::info Note

It is recommended to perform the above steps in a single transaction.
