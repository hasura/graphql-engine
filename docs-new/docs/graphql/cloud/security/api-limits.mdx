# API limits

## Introduction

Limiting the depth and/or rate of API requests can help prevent API performance issues caused by malicious or poorly implemented queries.

## API limit types

API limits are defined by **role** (e.g. anonymous, user) and can restrict request rate, depth, or both. Unique request parameters can include IP address or session variables (_x-hasura-user-id_, _x-hasura-org-id_, etc.)

### Rate limits

Restricts number of GraphQL operations per minute. This uses a sliding window approach. This means whenever Hasura Pro receives a request, it will count the rate of that client starting from the current time to last one minute.

By default, the rate-limit happens on the `role_name` i.e the value provided in `X-HASURA-ROLE`. But you can also combine additional unique parameters for more granularity.

The Unique Parameters that are provided are:

1.  IP Address
2.  Session Variables

You can choose any one of the above parameters to rate limit the requests.

**Note**: If you set a `Unique Parameter` then the combination of both the `role_name` and the `Unique Parameter` will be used to rate-limit requests.

Example:

If you rate-limit using the `role_name` and set the unique parameter for the rate-limit as `IP Address`, then rate-limit will be applied depending on both those parameteres. i.e If the requests come from a different role but same IP address will **NOT** be rate limited

### Depth limits

Restricts a GraphQL operation based on its depth, preventing deeply nested queries.

:::info Note

GraphQL introspection queries are excluded from depth limits.

:::

You can see various queries as examples and their depths here:

```graphql

  # depth = 1
  query deep1_1 {
    viewer {
      name
    }
  }

  query deep1_2 {
    viewer {
      ... on User {
        name
      }
    }
  }

  # depth = 2
  query deep2 {
    viewer {
      albums {
        title
      }
    }
  }

  # depth = 3
  query deep3 {
    viewer {
      albums {
        ...musicInfo
        songs{
          ...musicInfo
        }
      }
    }
  }

  fragment musicInfo on Music {
    id
    title
    artists
  }
```

### Node limits

Restricts a GraphQL operation based on the number of nodes. This helps in limiting the number of different pieces of related data to be fetched.

A node is defined as a field with a selection set.

For example, in the below query the number of nodes is 3 and they are `author`, `articles` and `homepage_entries`.

```graphql
{
  author {
    name
    articles {
      id
      title
    }
  }
  homepage_entries {
    article_id
  }
}
```

### Time limits

Restricts the time that a GraphQL operation is allowed to take. The duration is specified in seconds.

Any upstream database queries are also cancelled for supported sources. Currently, cancellation only works for Postgres sources.

## Manage API limits

API limits can have a _global_ or _per role_ configuration. If an incoming request does not contain a valid role then the global limit is applied.

:::info Admin & IntrospectionQuery exemptions

All API limits are **not** applied for the admin role, and depth limits are **NOT** applied to introspection queries.

:::

## Metadata Specification

Hasura provides two metadata API's to manage API limits

### Setting API Limits

You can configure api limits using the `set_api_limits` API.

```yaml
type: set_api_limits
args:
  disabled: # Optional Field (Either True or False, The value is False by default)

  depth_limit: # Optional API Limit
    global: # Mandatory Field
    per_role: # Optional Field
      <role_name>: <limit value> # Eg: user: 5

  node_limit: # Optional API Limit
    global: # Mandatory Field
    per_role: # Optional Field
      <role_name>: <limit value> # Eg: user: 5

  rate_limit: # Optional API Limit
    global: # Mandatory Field
      unique_params: # Optional Field, Can either be IP Address or Session variables
      max_reqs_per_min: # Mandatory Field

    per_role: # Optional Field
      <role_name>:
        max_reqs_per_min: # Mandatory Field
        unique_params: # Optional Field

  time_limit: # Optional API Limit
    global: # Mandatory Field
    per_role: # Optional Field
      <role_name>: <limit value> # Eg: user: 5
```

In the above metadata spec:

1.  The API Limits are `Enabled` by default, i.e the default value of `disabled` is `False`
2.  When `disabled` is `False` and none of the API Limits are set then no API limits are applied.
3.  The `global` field in all the API Limits is mandatory, and is used as the default API limit if no `per_role` option is set for the user.
4.  The `per_role` can be used to override the `global` API Limit value
5.  For `rate_limit` if no `unique_params` are provided then, the requests will be rate-limited on the `role_name` i.e the `X-HASURA-ROLE` that is used to issue the request

Example Metadata Spec:

```yaml
type: set_api_limits
args:
  disabled: false

  depth_limit:
    global: 5
    per_role:
      user: 7

  node_limit:
    global: 3
    per_role:
      user: 10

  rate_limit:
    global:
      unique_params: IP
      max_reqs_per_min: 10
    per_role:
      anonymous:
        max_reqs_per_min: 10
        unique_params: "ip"
      user:
        unique_params:
          - x-hasura-user-id
          - x-hasura-team-id
        max_reqs_per_min: 20

  time_limit:
    global: 10
    per_role:
      user: 5
```

### Removing API Limits

You can remove **all** the api limits that have been set using `remove_api_limit` API.

```yaml
type: remove_api_limits
args: {}
```
