# Enable HTTPS for the Hasura EE Control Plane dashboard

<div className='badge badge--primary heading-badge'>Available on: Enterprise Edition</div>

## Overview

Modify the `global.uriScheme` value to `https` in the `overrides-values.yaml` and redeploy both lux and hge-pro using
earlier instructions. Restart all non-stateful services to enable https.

With the above steps, HTTPS ingress configs are created. Appropriate certificates can be generated using Cert Manager &
LetsEncrypt, setup instructions can be found [here](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/kubernetes/).
