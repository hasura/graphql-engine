# Postgres: Live query subscriptions

## Introduction

A Live query subscription will return the latest result of the query being made
and not necessarily all the individual events leading up to the result.

By default, updates are delivered to clients every **1 sec**.

See more details on [subscriptions execution and performance](/graphql/core/databases/postgres/subscriptions/livequery/execution-and-performance.mdx).

## Convert a query to a subscription

You can turn any query into a subscription by simply replacing `query`
with `subscription` as the operation type.

:::info Caveat

Hasura follows the [GraphQL spec](https://graphql.github.io/graphql-spec/June2018/#sec-Single-root-field)
which allows for only one root field in a subscription.

## Use cases

- [Subscribe to the latest value of a particular field](/graphql/core/databases/postgres/subscriptions/livequery/use-cases.mdx#pg-subscribe-field)
- [Subscribe to changes to a tableâ€™s entries](/graphql/core/databases/postgres/subscriptions/livequery/use-cases.mdx#pg-subscribe-table)
- [Subscribe to the latest value of some derived data](/graphql/core/databases/postgres/subscriptions/livequery/use-cases.mdx#pg-subscribe-derived)
