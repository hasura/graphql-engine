# Tips and tricks

This document contains various tips and tricks to make development easier.

## Use curl and yaml2json to test the graphql-engine API directly

- [yaml2json](https://github.com/bronze1man/yaml2json) - many of our tests are written in yaml, this utility can convert them to json which graphql-engine understands

Example invocation:

```sh
cat /tmp/metadata.yaml | yaml2json | curl -d @- http://localhost:8181/v1/metadata
```

## Convert a test case to a live example

To manually run an integration test one needs to:

- Run `scripts/dev.sh <postgres|graphql-engine|mssql>`
- import the metadata or connect to DBs as you need
- initialise the MSSQL DB with the raw SQL page
- test the thing via GraphiQL

Fortunately this process can be somewhat automated.
We'll use the `TestGraphQLQueryBasicMSSQL` test as an example.

### Prerequisites

- [yaml2json](#use-curl-and-yaml2json-to-test-the-graphql-engine-api-directly)
- curl

### Start-up graphql-engine

First step stays the same. Start up the relevant databases and graphql-engine in seperate terminals.

We also need mssql for this test, this can be skipped if you're testing postgres for example.

```sh
scripts/dev.sh postgres
```
```sh
scripts/dev.sh mssql
```
```sh
scripts/dev.sh graphql-engine
```

### Connect to a database

In the case of mssql, we also need to register the database. This can be done in the hasura console but going to
the `DATA` tab, then `Manage` button on the left and then `Connect Database` button. Add a mssql database with the
connection string that `scripts/dev.sh mssql` outputed.

Note: the database name should match the `source` field that tests use. In mssql's case this is usually `mssql`.

### Setup schema

The test `TestGraphQLQueryBasicMSSQL` is defined in `server/tests-py/test_graphql_queries.py`.
From there we can learn that the test files are found in the `dir` `server/tests-py/queries/graphql_query/basic`.

For mssql, we are looking for these files:

- `setup_schema_mssql.yaml` - creates tables and inserts values
- `setup_mssql.yaml` - creates relationships, permissions, etc.

And we will run them in that order.

For postgres tests, you will want to run `setup.yaml` and maybe `values_setup.yaml` as well.

We will setup an api call to graphql-engine per setup file:

```sh
cat server/tests-py/queries/graphql_query/basic/schema_setup_mssql.yaml | yaml2json | curl -d @- localhost:8181/v2/query
cat server/tests-py/queries/graphql_query/basic/setup_mssql.yaml | yaml2json | curl -d @- localhost:8181/v1/metadata
```

### Run tests

We have two options:

1. Take the query from the test you like and run in in graphql.
2. Extract the query into a separate file: `/tmp/query.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   query: |
     query {
       author {
         id
         name
       }
     }
   ```
   And use an api call:
   ```sh
   cat /tmp/query.yaml | yaml2json | curl -d @- localhost:8181/v1/graphql
   ```

   To include session variables, use the `-H` curl option:
   ```sh
   cat /tmp/query.yaml | yaml2json | curl -H "X-Hasura-Role: user" -H "X-Hasura-User-Id: 1" -d @- localhost:8181/v1/graphql
   ```

### Cleanup

Easiest way to clean-up is to terminate graphql-engine and the database.

But it is also possible to run the teardown files against graphql-engine. Like this:

```sh
cat server/tests-py/queries/graphql_query/basic/teardown_mssql.yaml | yaml2json | curl -d @- localhost:8181/v1/metadata
cat server/tests-py/queries/graphql_query/basic/schema_teardown_mssql.yaml | yaml2json | curl -d @- localhost:8181/v2/query
```

## Run a remote MSSQL instance with dev.sh

Sometimes we might want to run a database such as MSSQL on a remote computer using `scripts/dev.sh mssql` and connect
to it from `graphql-engine` which runs on a different computer. Currently, mssql instance running using
`scripts/dev.sh mssql` will only be exposed to the machine it is run on.

To change that and expose it to other machines as well, we need to edit `scripts/containers/mssql.sh` and change
the `MSSQL_HOST` variable to the external IP of the machine.

## Add a unit test for SQL generation
We will look at the SQL generation of delete for MSSQL as an example. We want to test the conversion of `AnnDel` to structured SQL.

We can unit test individual transformations, for example that the `Hasura.Backends.MSSQL.FromIr.fromDelete`
function converts an `AnnDel` to the correct SQL `DELETE` statement, like this:

1. Add a new HSpec file in `server/src-test/Database/MSSQL/` named something like `DeleteSpec.hs`:
    - This test should expose a `spec` function with the tests
    - It can use the `shouldBe` or `shouldSatisfy` combinators to compare the input to the expected output
    - We can use `runValidate` and `runFromIr` just as it is used in the codebase to extract the value
2. We can use `ltrace` or similar to print the *input* to `fromDelete` when run from graphql-engine instead of crafting it by hand
3. We can print the output of the function when running the test, or craft the expected output ourselves
4. We need to add another line to `unitSpecs` in `server/src-test/main.hs`

**Note**: it is possible that `Eq` and `Show` instances will need to be added for the input and output types
for this to work (so that hspec can compare the values and display the expected/got mismatches)

### Test example

```hs
module Hasura.Backends.MSSQL.FromIRTest
  ( spec,
  )
where

import Control.Monad.Validate (runValidate)
import Database.ODBC.SQLServer
import Debug.Trace qualified as D
import Hasura.Backends.MSSQL.FromIr
import Hasura.Backends.MSSQL.Types.Internal hiding (FieldName)
import Hasura.Backends.MSSQL.Types.Internal qualified as MSSQL
import Hasura.Prelude
import Hasura.RQL.IR
import Hasura.RQL.Types
import Language.GraphQL.Draft.Syntax
import Test.Hspec

spec :: Spec
spec =
  describe "Translate Delete" $
    it "AnnDel to Delete" $ do
      -- Can also be @`shouldBe` Right result@ instead
      runValidate (runFromIr (fromDelete input)) `shouldSatisfy` thing
  where
    thing =
      \case
        Left _ -> False
        Right x -> D.traceShow x True

input :: AnnDel 'MSSQL
input =
  AnnDel
    { dqp1Table = TableName {tableName = "author", tableSchema = "dbo"},
      dqp1Where =
        ( BoolAnd [],
          BoolAnd [...]
        ),
      dqp1Output = MOutMultirowFields [...],
      dqp1AllCols = [...]
    }

result :: Delete
result =
  Delete
    { deleteTable =
        Aliased
          { aliasedThing = TableName {tableName = "author", tableSchema = "dbo"},
            aliasedAlias = "t_author1"
          },
      deleteOutput = Output {...},
      deleteTempTable = TempTable {...},
      deleteWhere = Where [...]
    }
```
