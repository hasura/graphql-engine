-- | Returns the schema information for all supported directives, for each of
-- which a @DirectiveDefinition@ will be inserted into the schema.
--
-- To add a new custom directives to the schema, add it to @customDirectives@.
-- Inclusion directives are treated separately, as they are not concerned with
-- altering the result of the parsers, but about whether a given field should be
-- parsed at all (see @collectFields@ for more information).
--
-- Alternatively, you could manually add a @DirectiveInfo@ to this list;
-- however, if you do so, and do not provide a corresponding definition in
-- @customDirectives@, calls to @parseDirectives@ will NOT attempt to parse that
-- new directive: they will only validate that it is used correctly. You can use
-- this option to implement directives that do not match our simple inclusion /
-- custom dichotomy.
--
-- To create a directive definition, you need to create a @Directive@ using
-- @mkDirective@, and export from this module its corresponding @DirectiveKey@
-- (see @skip@ below for an example). Make sure the type in the key matches the
-- type of the parser!
--
-- Directives may be "hidden", in which case they won't advertised in the
-- schema, but silently accepted. This is un-advisable and should only be used
-- when there's no other way around it.

-- | Parses directives, given a location. Ensures that all directives are known
-- and match the location; subsequently builds a dependent map of the results,
-- that can be then introspected with @withDirective@. The list of parsers that
-- should be applied is given as an argument: if a valid directive is found, but
-- for which no parser is provided, it will be ignored.
--
-- Example use:
--
--     dMap <- parseDirectives customDirectives (DLExecutable EDLQUERY) directives
--     withDirective dMap cached $ onJust \_ -> tagAsCached
