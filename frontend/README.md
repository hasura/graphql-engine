## Nx Console

It's highly recommended to install the Nx Console for [VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nrwl.angular-console), [IntelliJ](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/15101-nx-console-idea) or [Neovim](https://github.com/Equilibris/nx.nvim).

It will allow you to have all of the Nx commands usable via UI, have an embedded view of the NX graph right in your editor, and much more.

## Hasura Console

The Hasura Console is an admin dashboard to manage the connected database and to try out GraphQL APIs. It is a React application bundled with Webpack, and the state is managed mostly using Redux.
