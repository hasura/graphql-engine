# Recipes

## Introduction

This section contains recipes for common use cases of **Event Triggers**. Each recipe is a succinct, tested, and
reusable piece of code that can be used to solve a common use case. However, these recipes are not exhaustive and you
can use them as a starting point to build your own custom logic.

### Moderate user content with ChatGPT

A common use case for integrating AI-powered bots into applications is to take care of mundane tasks like moderating
user content. This can be done with specialized sentiment analysis tool or a general large language model like
[ChatGPT](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt). This recipe shows how to use ChatGPT to moderate reviews
submitted by users. We'll build a webhook that parses Event Trigger data, sends it to ChatGPT, and then performs
operations on our data based on the results. [Check it out](/event-triggers/recipes/moderate-user-content-with-gpt.mdx)!

### Optimize a product's description for SEO

Enhancing the SEO quality of product descriptions is important for e-commerce platforms. This guide illustrates how to
employ Hasura's Event Triggers to automatically invoke a webhook whenever a new product is added. The webhook interacts
with the [OpenAI ChatGPT API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt) to improve the product's description for
better SEO performance. By using this technique to optimize or check human entered content in this way, you can improve
the quality of your content and reduce the amount of time spent on manual review. Check out this
[recipe here](/event-triggers/recipes/product-description-chatgpt-seo.mdx).

### New user onboarding

This recipe shows how to use Hasura's Event Triggers to automatically send a welcome email to a new user when they sign
up. We'll build a webhook that parses Event Trigger data, sends an email, and then performs operations on our data based
on the results. [Check it out](/event-triggers/recipes/new-user-welcome.mdx)!

### Send a Notification when Order Status Changes

This recipe shows how to use Hasura's Event Triggers to automatically send a notification to a user when the status of
their order changes. We'll build a webhook that parses Event Trigger data and sends a notification using data received
in event. [Check it out](/event-triggers/recipes/order-status-notification.mdx)!
