# Commands

## Overview

The Hasura CLI Data Connector plugin utilizes a typical command / flag syntax enabling you to quickly manage your Hasura Data Connector deployments. A typical
command structure will follow this pattern:

```bash
hasura connector <command> --<optional_flag> "<optional_flag_value>"
```

A real-world example following this structure would be:

```bash
hasura connector create my-connector:v1 --github-repo-url https://github.com/hasura/weaviate_gdc/tree/main
```

This snippet illustrates the `create` command and the `github-repo-url` flag,
and the value of the `github-repo-url`.

## Getting help

At any time, you can use the `--help` flag on a certain command. Running
`hasura connector --help` will return information on available commands and flags:
