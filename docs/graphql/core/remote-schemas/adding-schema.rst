Introduction
------------

Follow the steps below to add a remote schema to the Hasura GraphQL engine.

Step 1: Write a custom GraphQL server
-------------------------------------

You need to create a custom GraphQL server with a schema and corresponding resolvers that solve your use case
(*if you already have a functional GraphQL server that meets your requirements, you can skip this step*).

You can use any language/framework of your choice to author this server and deploy it anywhere. A great way to get
started is to use one of our boilerplates:

- `Boilerplates <https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/tree/master/community/boilerplates/remote-schemas>`__

.. _merge_remote_schema:

Step 2: Merge remote schema
---------------------------

To merge your remote schema with the GraphQL engine's auto-generated schema:

.. rst-class:: api_tabs
.. tabs::

  .. tab:: Console

    Head to the ``Remote Schemas`` tab of the console and click on the ``Add`` button.

    .. thumbnail:: /img/graphql/core/business-logic/add-remote-schemas-interface.png
      :alt: Merge remote schema

    You need to enter the following information:

    - **Remote Schema name**: an alias for the remote schema that must be unique on an instance of the GraphQL engine.
    - **GraphQL server URL**: the endpoint at which your remote GraphQL server is available. This value can be entered
      manually or by specifying an environment variable that contains this information.

  .. tab:: CLI

    To add a remote schema, edit the ``remote_schemas.yaml`` file in the ``metadata`` directory as in this example:

    .. code-block:: yaml
      :emphasize-lines: 1-5

      - name: my-remote-schema
        definition:
          url: https://graphql-pokemon.now.sh/
          timeout_seconds: 60
          forward_client_headers: true

    Apply the metadata by running:

    .. code-block:: bash

      hasura metadata apply

  .. tab:: API

    You can add a remote schema by using the :ref:`add_remote_schema metadata API <add_remote_schema>`:

    .. code-block:: http

      POST /v1/query HTTP/1.1
      Content-Type: application/json
      X-Hasura-Role: admin

      {
          "type": "add_remote_schema",
          "args": {
              "name": "my-remote-schema",
              "definition": {
                  "url": "https://graphql-pokemon.now.sh/",
                  "forward_client_headers": true,
                  "timeout_seconds": 60
              }
          }
      }


.. note::

    If you are running Hasura using Docker, ensure that the Hasura Docker container can reach the server endpoint.
    See :ref:`this page <docker_networking>` for Docker networking.

    If you are adding the URL using env variable, then run the Hasura docker container with the env variable added during `docker run`. Example ``-e REMOTE_SCHEMA_ENDPOINT=http://host.docker.internal:4000/mycustomgraphql``.

- **Headers**: configure the headers to be sent to your custom GraphQL server:

  - Toggle forwarding all headers sent by the client (when making a GraphQL query) to your remote GraphQL server.
  - Send additional headers to your remote server - these can be static header name-value pairs; and/or pairs of
    "header name-environment variable name". You can specify the value of the header to be picked up from the environment
    variable.

    **Example**: Let's say your remote GraphQL server needs a ``X-Api-Key`` as a header. As this value contains
    sensitive data (like API key in this example), you can configure the name of an environment variable which will hold
    the value. This environment variable needs to be present when you start the GraphQL engine. When Hasura sends
    requests to your remote server, it will pick up the value from this environment variable.

.. admonition:: Using environment variables

  If you are using environment variables in the remote schema configuration - either
  for URL or headers - **the environment variables need to be present**  with valid values
  when adding the remote schema i.e. the GraphQL engine should be started with these environment variables.

Click on the ``Add Remote Schema`` button to merge the remote schema.

Step 3: Make queries to the remote server from Hasura
-----------------------------------------------------

.. rst-class:: api_tabs
.. tabs::

  .. tab:: Via console

    Now you can head to the ``GraphiQL`` tab and make queries to your remote server from Hasura.

  .. tab:: Via API

    You can query your remote server by making requests to the Hasura GraphQL endpoint (``/v1/graphql``).

Points to remember
------------------

Remote schema fields nomenclature
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Top-level field names need to be unique across all merged schemas (*case-sensitive match*).
- Types with the *exact same name and structure* will be merged. But types with the *same name but different
  structure* will result in type conflicts.


Schema refreshing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For versions <= ``v1.0.0-beta.2``, GraphQL schema of each added remote server is refreshed every time a
metadata modifying operation like adding tables/functions, defining relationships/permissions etc. is done.

From ``v1.0.0-beta.3`` onwards, a remote server's GraphQL schema is cached and refreshed only when user
explicitly reloads the remote schema.

.. rst-class:: api_tabs
.. tabs::

  .. tab:: Console

    Click the ``Reload`` button in the ``Remote schema`` section on the Hasura console.

  .. tab:: API

    Make a request to the :ref:`reload_remote_schema<reload_remote_schema>` API.

Current limitations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Nodes from different GraphQL servers cannot be used in the same query/mutation. All top-level fields have to be
  from the same GraphQL server.
- Subscriptions on remote GraphQL servers are not supported.

These limitations will be addressed in upcoming versions.

Extending the auto-generated GraphQL schema fields
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For some use cases, you may need to extend the GraphQL schema fields exposed by the Hasura GraphQL engine
(and not merely add new fields as we have done :ref:`here <merge_remote_schema>`) with a custom schema/server.
To support them, you can use community tooling to write your own client-facing GraphQL gateway that interacts with the GraphQL engine.

.. note::

  **Adding an additional layer on top of the Hasura GraphQL engine significantly impacts the performance provided by
  it out of the box** (*by as much as 4x*). If you need any help with remodelling these kinds of use cases to use the
  built-in remote schemas feature, please get in touch with us on `Discord <https://discord.gg/vBPpJkS>`__.
