The following issues were raised but disallowed by compatibility configuration:

The field 'staff' in object type 'institution (in subgraph default)' cannot be mapped to data connector 'custom (in subgraph default)' field 'institution.staff' because: Type '[staff_member!]! (in subgraph default)' is not compatible with NDC type 'Array { element_type: Nullable { underlying_type: Named { name: TypeName("staff_member") } } }' - Expected a non-nullable type
