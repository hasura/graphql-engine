# Links

Please refer [this](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html?highlight=links#hyperlinks) to get familiar with links in Sphinx

## External Links

These are straightforward syntax swap as given below.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="sphinx" label="Sphinx - RST" default>

    `Hasura Cloud <https://cloud.hasura.io/signup/>`_

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="docusaurus" label="Docusaurus - MDX">

    [Hasura Cloud](https://cloud.hasura.io/signup/)

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Internal Links

Sphinx uses `:ref:` to simplify cross-referencing documents. You can read more about how it works in [sphinx docs](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/roles.html#ref-role)

Since MDX doesn't yet support this direct referencing, we have to rely on relative/root relative path resolution for [referencing other documents](https://docusaurus.io/docs/docs-markdown-features#referencing-other-documents).

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="sphinx" label="Sphinx - RST" default>

```rest
// highlight-next-line
:ref:`cloud_getting_started`

where `cloud_getting_started` is id of the document given at top of RST file.

Link label will by default be title of page. For custom link labels, the syntax might look like below.

// highlight-next-line
:ref:`Remote schemas <remote_schemas>`
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="docusaurus" label="Docusaurus - MDX">

```markdown
[Getting Started With Hasura Cloud](../relative/path/to/getting-started-document.mdx)

[Remote Schemas](../relative/path/to/remote-schemas-document.mdx)
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info A quick note on id's in reStructuredText

Similar to how a top level id will resolve to file/document, a sub-section can also have id's and they resolve to a section within the document.

This is similar to using hash in the url (`#sub-section`) to directly link to a section in the page.

While the top level can be added as `id` attribute in metadata. The sub-section (h2's, h3's and stuff) can have id's with special mdx syntax `{#id-for-sub-section}`

![Referencing sub-section in rst vs markdown](/img/rst-vs-mdx-guide/link-sub-section-ids.png)

:::

:::caution

```rst
:ref:`cloud_getting_started`
```

this Will actually resolve to a link with label. Label is the title of the document with respective id.

So the MDX, should be with the label (please always refer live docs site to see how this link looks in UI - lable + url)

:::

:::danger be cautious with URL slug

If we add an `id` metadata for the document, the url slug for this page will be overridden to `id` as opposed to default filename. Thus requiring us to set a slug if we intend to leave it default.

So, we can skip the top level id in metadata as it is by default the filename without extension.

Read more about it from [Docusaurus Document Id Section](https://docusaurus.io/docs/docs-introduction#document-id)

### Root Relative Links

While relative paths works absolutely fine, this can easily lead to an absolute mess when files are move around. Thus requiring manual effort to fix the paths.

To avoid this scenario, we can use root relative paths. The path will still break when moved around, but it is lot easier to find and replace. Find with old path and replace with new path.

```
Find `/folder1/subfolder2/doc3.mdx` and replace with `/folder1/newsubfolder4/doc5.mdx`
```

Since MDX doesn't yet support direct document referencing with `id/ref` unlike sphinx, we need to settle with root relative path linking for now.

```
[MDX Root Relative Link](/rst-vs-mdx-guide/index.mdx#contents-covered)
```


> [MDX Root Relative Link](/rst-vs-mdx-guide/index.mdx#contents-covered)

:::tip Don't forget the extension!

Make sure to include file extension as MDX links are parsed as a file path and will be resolved correctly.

## Links in React

Use Docusaurus [Links](https://docusaurus.io/docs/docusaurus-core#link) for linking in React. Works for both internal and external links.

```jsx
import Link from '@docusaurus/Link';

// Internal Link
<Link to="/rst-vs-mdx-guide/links#root-relative-links">Root Relative Links</Link>

// External Link
<Link to="https://hasura.io">Hasura</Link>
```

<hr />

:::info

React Link's `to` attribute will always accept a URL path and not file path.

Docusaurus catches [broken markdown links](https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/docusaurus-config#onbrokenmarkdownlinks) if enabled
