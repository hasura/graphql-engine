# Roles & Session variables

## Roles

Every table/view can have permission rules for users based on their
role.

By default, there is an `admin` role that can perform any operation on
any table.

You can define roles and then create permissions for each of these
roles:

Examples:

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>user</td>
<td>A logged-in user</td>
<td>CRUD on data that belongs to them</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>anonymous</td>
<td>A not logged-in user</td>
<td>Only read from some tables/views</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>manager</td>
<td>A user that has access to other userâ€™s data</td>
<td>CRUD on all users data</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

See [this page](/graphql/core/auth/authorization/permission-rules.mdx) on how to configure permission rules.

:::info Role-based schemas

For every role that you create, Hasura automatically publishes a
different GraphQL schema that represents the right queries, fields, and
mutations that are available to that role.

## Dynamic session variables {#dynamic-session-variables}

Permission rules can also refer to *session variables*. Session
variables are key-value pairs returned from the authentication service
for each request.

For example: If a user makes a request, the session token maps to a
`user-id`. This `user-id` can be used in a permission to show that
inserts into a table are only allowed if the `user_id` column has a
value equal to that of `user-id`, the session variable.

When you are constructing permission rules, however, there might be
several variables that represent the business logic of having access to
data. For example, if you have a SaaS application, you might restrict
access based on a `client_id` variable. If you want to provide different
levels of access on different devices, you might restrict access based
on a `device_type` variable.

Hasura allows you to create permission rules that can use any dynamic
variable that is a property of the request. All your dynamic variables
must follow the naming convention `X-Hasura-*`.

Examples:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th width="20%">Example</th>
<th width="10%">Role</th>
<th width="20%">Condition</th>
<th width="50%">Permission expression</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><p>Allow access to user's own row</p></td>
<td><p><code>user</code></p></td>
<td><p><code>user_id</code> column is equal to <code>session-user-id</code> from a request</p></td>
<td>

```json
{
  "user_id": {
    "_eq": "X-Hasura-User-Id"
  }
}
```

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>Allow project admins access to anything that belongs to the project</p></td>
<td><p><code>project-admin</code></p></td>
<td><p><code>project_id</code> column is equal to <code>project-id</code> of the "session user"</p></td>
<td>

```json
{
  "project_id": {
    "_eq": "X-Hasura-Project-Id"
  }
}
```

</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

:::info ABAC

Session variables are analogous to _attributes_ in a typical
[attribute-based access control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute-based_access_control)
(ABAC) system.

## Modelling Roles in Hasura

General guidelines for modelling roles in Hasura.

Roles are typically modelled in two ways:

1.  **Hierarchical roles**: Access scopes are nested depending on
    available roles. [Roles in GitHub for organisations](https://help.github.com/en/articles/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles)
    is a great example of such modelling where access scopes are
    inherited by deeper roles:

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/graphql/core/auth/github-org-hierarchical-roles.png"
  alt="Hierarchical roles"
/>

2.  **Flat roles**: Non-hierarchical roles with each role requiring an
    independent access scope to be defined.

**Roles in Hasura have to be defined in the latter way i.e. in a flat,
non-hierarchical model**.

To convert the above hierarchical roles model into the one expected by
Hasura, you will need to model roles as partially captured by the table
below (_showing access permissions for the_ `user` _&_ `org-member`
_roles_, `repositories` _table and_ `select` _operation_):

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th width="27%">Role</th>
<th width="22%">Access Permissions</th>
<th width="50%">Example permission rule</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>user</td>
<td><p>Allow access to personally created repositories</p></td>
<td>

```json
{
  "creator_id": {
    "_eq": "X-Hasura-User-Id"
   }
 }
```

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>org-member</td>
<td><p>Allow access to personally created repositories and the organisation's repositories</p></td>
<td>

```json
{
  "_or": [
    {
      "creator_id": {
        "_eq": "X-Hasura-User-Id"
      }
    },
    {
      "organization": {
        "members": {
          "member_id" : {
            "_eq" : "X-Hasura-User-Id"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Making role-based user information available

Effective permission rules require that information about which roles
have access to which objects is available when processing the permission
rule. Different users with the same role or the same user with different
roles may have access to different sets of rows of the same table.

In some cases this is straightforward - for example, to restrict access
for authors to only their articles, a trivial row-level permission like
`"creator_id": {"_eq": "X-Hasura-User-Id"}` will suffice. In others,
like our example in the previous section, this user information
(_ownership or relationship_) must be available for defining a
permission rule.

These non-trivial use cases are to be handled differently based on
whether this information is available in the same database or not.

#### Relationship information is available in the same database

Let's take a closer look at the permission rule for the `org-member`
rule in the example from the previous section. The rule reads as "_allow
access to this repository if it was created by this user or if this user
is a member of the organisation that this repository belongs to_".

The crucial piece of user information that is presumed to be available
in the same database and that makes this an effective rule, is the
mapping of users (_members_) to organizations.

Since this information is available in the same database, it can be
easily leveraged via
[Relationships in permissions](/graphql/core/auth/authorization/permission-rules.mdx#relationships-in-permissions) (_see this
reference for another example of the same kind_).

#### Relationship information is **not** available in the same database

When this user information is not available in the database that Hasura
is configured to use, session variables are the only avenue to pass this
information to a permission rule. In our example, the mapping of users
(members) to organizations may not have been available in the same
database.

To convey this information, a session variable, say
`X-Hasura-Allowed-Organisations` can be used by the configured
authentication to relay this information. We can then check for the
following condition to emulate the same rule: _is the organization that
this repository belongs to part of the list of the organizations the
user is a member of_.

The permission for `org-member` role changes to this:

```json
{
  "_or": [
    {
      "creator_id": {
        "_eq": "X-Hasura-User-Id"
      }
    },
    {
      "organization_id": {
        "_in": "X-Hasura-Allowed-Organisations"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

:::info Array session variables in permission rules

Support for using session variables for array operators like `_in`,
`_nin`, `_has_any_keys`, `_has_all_keys` is available in versions
`v1.0.0-beta.3` and above.

When you use array operators such as `_in` in the permissions builder in
the Hasura console, it will automatically open an array for your values.
If your session variable value is already an array, you can click the
`[X-Hasura-Allowed-Ids]` suggestion to remove the brackets and set your
session variable in its place.

:::

## Format of session variables

Session variables are currently expected to be Strings and should be
encoded as Postgres's literals for the relevant type.

For example, in the above example, let's say `creator_id` and
`organisation_id` columns are of type `integer`, then the values of
`X-Hasura-User-Id` and `X-Hasura-Allowed-Organisations` should be of
type `integer` and `integer[]` (an integer array) respectively. To pass
say a value `1` for `X-Hasura-User-Id`, it'll be "`1`" and if the
allowed organisations are `1`, `2` and `3`, then
`X-Hasura-Allowed-Organisations` will be "`{1,2,3}`". `{}` is the syntax
for specifying [arrays in Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/arrays.html#ARRAYS-INPUT).

The types and their formats are detailed
[here](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype.html). When in
doubt about the Postgres format for a type, you can always test it in
the SQL window. To check if `s` is a valid literal for type `t` then,
you can check it as follows:

```sql
select 's'::t;
```

If the above command returns data, then `s` is a valid literal of type
`t`. For example, to check if `{hello,world}` is a valid format of type
`text[]`, you can run:

```sql
select '{hello,world}'::text[];
```

:::info JSON format

In future, we'll add support for passing session variables as JSON
values where possible (i.e, auth webhook and JWT but not in headers).
