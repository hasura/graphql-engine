# Vercel Integration

## Introduction

You can connect your front-end [Vercel](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
applications with a [Hasura Cloud](https://cloud.hasura.io/) project.

This integration does the following:

- Creates a new Hasura Cloud project which can serve as a unified
  back-end for one or more front-end applications i.e. Vercel Projects
  depending on the scope of the integration.

- Configures necessary project settings i.e setting environment variables and exposing them on the client side.
  (Check the [list](#vercel-environment-variables) of all environment variables set).

## Creating an Integration

You can configure the [official Hasura integration](https://vercel.com/integrations/hasura-v1) with your Vercel account.

### Step 0: Prerequisites

This integration requires you to have a Vercel account along with existing Vercel applications.


### Step 1: Initiate Integration

- Navigate to the [official Hasura integration](https://vercel.com/integrations/hasura-v1) page and click on `Add Integration`.

### Step 3: Select Integration Scope

- Select the integration scope.

  | Scope             | Description                                        |
  |-------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
  | All Projects      | Configures all Vercel applications in the account. |

    width="400px"
  />

- Click on `Add Integration` and a new window should pop up for the further steps specific to Hasura Cloud.


### Step 4: Configure Hasura Cloud

- You'll be directed towards a Hasura Cloud signup or login page. This is skipped if you are already logged-in to Hasura Cloud.

- Once you are logged in, a Hasura Cloud project is created for the integration and the required
  [environment variables](#vercel-environment-variables) are set for each Vercel project in the scope.

- Click on the first link to navigate to your Hasura Cloud project Console to configure your GraphQL API and connect to a database.
  Check out the section on [database setup](/graphql/cloud/projects/create.mdx#cloud-projects-db-setup) on how to do this.

## Environment variables {#vercel-environment-variables}

- List of Hasura Cloud environment variables configured by the integration for each Vercel application in the scope of the integration:

  | Title                               | Description                                                       |
  |-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | HASURA_PROJECT_ENDPOINT             | GraphQL API endpoint of the Hasura Cloud project.                 |
  | NEXT_PUBLIC_HASURA_PROJECT_ENDPOINT | GraphQL API endpoint to be exposed on the Next.js browser client. |
  | HASURA_ADMIN_SECRET                 | Admin secret key to access your GraphQL API.                      |

  - You can check the environment variables configured by the integration for you in the respective Vercel Project's settings
    on Vercel dashboard. These are set up for `Development`, `Preview` and `Production` environments.
    Check the [Vercel docs](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/environment-variables) for environment variables for further reference.

    />


:::info Note

- If a [custom domain](/graphql/cloud/projects/domains.mdx) is added to the Hasura Cloud project, you'll have to set this custom value to
  `HASURA_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` and `NEXT_HASURA_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` manually in the respective Vercel project's settings.
- Similarly if the Hasura Cloud project's admin secret is changed, you will have to edit the `HASURA_ADMIN_SECRET` manually in the respective Vercel project's settings.

## Adding and removing projects from the Scope of Integration {#vercel-change-scope}

Once the integration is installed, you can change the scope of the
integration.

- Navigate to the installed integration page and click on `Manage Access`. This will show you the current status of the integration,
  i.e the projects that are currently configured.

    width="1146px"
  />

- If the integration is installed for `All Projects`, you can change the scope to `Specific Projects` and select the projects from the
  dropdown you want to keep the integration on. If installed for `Specific Projects`, you can add individual projects from the
  dropdown or remove them from the list.
