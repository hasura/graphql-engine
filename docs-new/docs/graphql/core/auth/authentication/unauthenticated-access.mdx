# Unauthenticated / Public access

## Introduction

It is a common requirement to have requests which are accessible to all
users without the need for any authentication (logging in). For example,
to display a public feed of events.

Once you have configured an [admin secret](/graphql/core/deployment/securing-graphql-endpoint.mdx),
by default Hasura GraphQL engine will reject any unauthenticated request
it receives.

You can configure Hasura GraphQL engine to allow access to
unauthenticated users by defining a specific role which will be set for
all unauthenticated requests. Once an unauthenticated role is
configured, unauthenticated requests will not be rejected and instead
the request will be made with the configured role.

This role can then be used to define the permissions for unauthenticated
users as described in [Authorization / Access control](/graphql/core/auth/authorization/index.mdx). A guide on setting up
unauthenticated user permissions can be found
[here](/graphql/core/auth/authorization/common-roles-auth-examples.mdx#anonymous-users-example).

:::caution Risk of using session variables

It is recommended to not use
[session variables](/graphql/core/auth/authorization/roles-variables.mdx#dynamic-session-variables) in the permissions of an
unauthenticated role because the source of the session variables cannot
be trusted. As session variables can be passed using request headers, a
user can choose to send any values for them and it needs to be ensured
that they can't get access to sensitive data just by setting different
values for their session variables.

## Configuring unauthenticated / public access

An unauthenticated role can be configured for the following scenarios:
no auth setup, webhook auth setup or JWT auth setup.

### No auth setup

With no auth setup, every request is considered an unauthenticated
request.

You can use the env variable `HASURA_GRAPHQL_UNAUTHORIZED_ROLE` or the
`--unauthorized-role` flag to set a role for unauthenticated (non-logged
in) users. See [GraphQL Engine server config reference](/graphql/core/deployment/graphql-engine-flags/reference.mdx) for more details on setting this
flag/env var.

### Webhooks

For [webhook authentication](/graphql/core/auth/authentication/webhook.mdx), any request for which the
webhook returns a `401 Unauthorized` response is considered an
unauthenticated request.

To allow unauthenticated access, the auth webhook should return a `200`
status response with your unauthenticated role in the headers. For
details on the webhook response, refer to
[this section](/graphql/core/auth/authentication/webhook.mdx#webhook-response).

### JWT

For [JWT authentication](/graphql/core/auth/authentication/jwt.mdx), any request which does not contain
a JWT token is considered an unauthenticated request.

You can use the env variable `HASURA_GRAPHQL_UNAUTHORIZED_ROLE` or the
`--unauthorized-role` flag to set a role for unauthenticated (non-logged
in) users. See [GraphQL Engine server config reference](/graphql/core/deployment/graphql-engine-flags/reference.mdx) for more details on setting this
flag/env var.
