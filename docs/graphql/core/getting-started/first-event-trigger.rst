Introduction
------------

You can use Hasura to setup event triggers that call configured webhooks whenever specific database events occur.

Let's create a sample event trigger with https://httpbin.org as our simple webhook.

Create a table
--------------

Head to the Hasura console, navigate to ``Data -> Create table`` and create a sample table called ``profile`` with
the following columns:

.. code-block:: sql

  profile (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT
  )

Setup an event trigger
----------------------

In the Hasura console, navigate to ``Events -> Create trigger`` and:

1. Enter trigger name as ``echo``.
2. Select table ``profile`` from the table dropdown.
3. Select operations: ``insert``, ``update`` and ``delete``.
4. Enter webhook URL as: ``https://httpbin.org/post``.

This sets up our webhook ``https://httpbin.org/post`` to receive database changes on an insert, update and delete on
``profile`` table.


Watch the trigger in action
---------------------------

1. Insert some sample data into the ``profile`` table using the ``Insert Row`` tab.
2. Now navigate to the ``Events`` tab and click on the ``echo`` trigger in the left sidebar.
3. Expand the details of an event to see the response from the webhook.
