# Async actions

Sometimes you may not want to wait for an action to complete before
sending a response back to the client (say if the business logic takes a
long time). In such cases you can create an **asynchronous** action,
which returns an `action_id` immediately to the client before contacting
the handler.

If you mark an action as **asynchronous**, Hasura also generates a
`query` and a `subscription` field for the action so that you can
query/subscribe to its status.

:::info Note

Only actions of type `mutation` can be async. Actions of type query are
always executed synchronously.

:::

For example, let's say `place_order` is an asynchronous action

```graphql
mutation placeOrderRequest($order_input: place_order_input!) {
  place_order(input: $order_input)
}
```

Executing this mutation will return a response like:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "place_order": "23b1c256-7aff-4b95-95bd-68220d9f93f2"
  }
}
```

The returned `uuid` is the `action id` of the async action. To get the
actual response of the action, you can `query` or `subscribe` to the
action using this `action id`.

```graphql
subscription getPlaceOrderResponse {
  place_order (id: "23b1c256-7aff-4b95-95bd-68220d9f93f2") {
    output
    errors
  }
}
```
