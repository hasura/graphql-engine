# Bullet Lists

* Don't use bullet points for one point.
* Make sure that content which belongs under a bullet point is actually indented under that bullet point in markdown.
* Use a period at the end of bullet lists which are a sentence, like this.
* Bullet points should not have a blank line between each point.
