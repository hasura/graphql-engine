## Version upgrades

When using Hasura Cloud, upgrades to the service happen automatically on a regular basis. These upgrades are designed to
improve the functionality and security of the service, and to ensure that you always have access to the latest features
and bug fixes.

When a new version of Hasura Cloud is released, your instance will be automatically upgraded to the new version. This
happens without any action required on your part, and should not cause any disruption to your service.

:::info Note

Please see the [API reference](/api-reference/cloud-api-reference.mdx) to create and manage Hasura Cloud projects
programmatically.
