# Getting access to the built products with the `cabal v2-*` commands is really awkward; see

# little more context. Ideally, we could use `cabal v2-install` for this, but `v2-install` does
# strange and complicated things, and I could not get it to work.
#
# This glob is a pretty heavy hammer designed to work regardless of `cabal-install` version (see the
# aforementioned link for why thatâ€™s tricky). If `cabal v2-*` ever gets a better way to do this,
# please replace this with something less hacky.
