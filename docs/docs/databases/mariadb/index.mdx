## Introduction

Hasura enables you to connect to MariaDB databases to automatically build a rich GraphQL API based on your database
schema.

At present, our MariaDB integration is available for testing in Hasura Cloud and Docker environments, where you can run
Hasura GraphQL Engine and connect the MariaDB GraphQL Data Connector to it. For more information on GraphQL Data
Connectors check out [our blog post on the topic](https://hasura.io/blog/hasura-graphql-data-connectors/).

To get started with MariaDB, check out our [Getting Started with Docker](/databases/mariadb/docker.mdx) guide.

:::tip Supported versions:

1.  Hasura GraphQL Engine `v2.23.0` onwards
2.  MariaDB version 10.5 and higher

:::

:::tip Supported features

Hasura currently supports queries, mutations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE), table relationships, remote relationships and
permissions on MariaDB.

Note that Hasura doesn't yet support the ability to modify the database schema for MariaDB, so the database you connect
to should already contain tables and data. You should also ideally have access to it outside of Hasura to modify the
schema.
