# Building an API Gateway for existing APIs with Hasura

## Introduction

Hasura can serve as a gateway to your existing APIs. It creates a bridge between clients and servers, enabling secure
and efficient data communication. Hasura's Data Federation enables one to compose data from different sources that
reside in independent data stores but are semantically related. Add existing data APIs (REST APIs, GRAPHQL APIs) with
Remote Schemas or Actions in Hasura as a single GraphQL schema without writing any custom code and add it to a Hasura
project to create a gateway which is secure and scalable that deliver high-performance data access.

## Sample use case

This tutorial assumes you have a separate server running with a set of APIs that need to be added behind the gateway.

Let's assume we have two services that needed to be added behind a gateway. The first service is a Hasura project
connected with postgres which contains the order details and can get all the orders for a user and can add a new order.
The second service is a microservice and exposes a REST API, which contains payment-related details.

When signing in with Hasura for the first time and clicking for use-case as `Using Hasura as Gateway for existing API`
it creates a Hasura project which we will use to create the gateway.

## Step 1: Connect Hasura project

Create a new project on [Hasura Cloud](https://cloud.hasura.io) for all your services and launch the Console to add the
existing microservice to Hasura.

## Step 2: Connect custom services to Hasura

### Step 2.1: Using Remote Schema

Hasura has the ability to merge your remote GraphQL schemas and provide you with a single, unified GraphQL API using
Remote Schemas. This enables you to write queries and mutations to disparate sources, all from your single Hasura
endpoint.

If the custom server has graphql endpoints, add the server to Hasura as a
[Remote Schema](/remote-schemas/adding-schema.mdx).

1. Head to the `Remote Schemas` tab of the Console and click `Add` on the left sidebar.
2. GraphQL server URL: the endpoint at which your remote GraphQL server is available. This value can be entered manually
   or by specifying an environment variable that contains this information.
3. Toggle forwarding all headers sent by the client (when making a GraphQL query) to your remote GraphQL server.
4. Add the required details and click on the `Add Remote Schema` button to merge the Remote Schema.

### Step 2.2: Using Actions

Actions are a convenient and secure way to connect to REST APIs to achieve any business logic you may need, directly
from your GraphQL API.

If the custom server exposes endpoints as a REST API, add the server to Hasura as an
[Action](/actions/rest-connectors.mdx). REST Connectors for Actions are used to integrate existing REST APIs to the
GraphQL API without needing any middleware or modifications to the upstream code.

1. Head to the `Actions` tab of the Console and click `Create` on the left sidebar and then click `New Action`.
2. Define your mutation or query and associated types for your REST API.

<Thumbnail src="/img/getting-started/action-definition.png" alt="Action Definition" width="1000px" />

3. Scroll down to `Configure the REST connectors`

<Thumbnail src="/img/actions/configure-rest-connectors.png" alt="Configure REST connectors for Actions" width="800px" />

The context variables available in transforms are:

| Context variable   | Value                                   |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| $body              | Original body of action request         |
| $base_url          | Original configured webhook handler URL |
| $session_variables | Session variables                       |

The Console allows you to preview your transforms while configuring them. To avoid exposing sensitive information on the
console UI the actual environment variables configured on the server are not resolved while displaying the previews

**For example:** If your webhook handler is set as an env var as shown below then pass a mock value for that env var in
the sample context:

<Thumbnail src="/img/actions/transform-sample-context-0.png" alt="Console action webhook handler" width="650px" />

4. Add Request Method: You can change the request method to adapt to your API's expected format.

<Thumbnail src="/img/actions/transform-method.png" alt="Change request method" width="800px" />

5. Request URL: The Request URL template allows you to configure the exact API endpoint to call.

<Thumbnail src="/img/actions/transform-key-value-url.png" alt="Change request URL" width="800px" />

6. Request Body: You can generate a custom request body by configuring a template to transform the default payload to a
   custom payload.

<Thumbnail src="/img/actions/transform-body-application-json.png" alt="payload body application/json" width="1100px" />

7. Response Body: You can transform the default body of your HTTP API response by configuring a response transform
   template.

9. Click on `Create Action` and you can navigate to API tab and check out the Action on the Console.

## Step 3: Add the custom service Hasura project to Gateway

Navigate to the Hasura Console for gateway project. If you do not have a Hasura project created, create a new project
using [Hasura Cloud](https://cloud.hasura.io). Add all the Hasura project's GraphQL endpoints as separate remote schema
by providing GraphQL Service URL as Hasura's GraphQL endpoint.

<Thumbnail src="/img/getting-started/remote-schema-for-gateway.png" alt="Remote Schema for Gateway" width="1000px" />

## Step 4: Explore GraphQL API

Navigate to API tab. On the explorer we can see all the endpoints available in the gateway from all the services.

## Step 5: Add remote schema permissions

### Step 5.1: Enable remote schema permissions

Navigate to [Hasura cloud](https://cloud.hasura.io) and open the project associated with the gateway. Navigate to env
vars and add `HASURA_GRAPHQL_ENABLE_REMOTE_SCHEMA_PERMISSIONS` as `true`. This env var
`HASURA_GRAPHQL_ENABLE_REMOTE_SCHEMA_PERMISSIONS` allows you to set permissions for Remote Schemas.

<Thumbnail src="/img/getting-started/env-var-remote-schema.png" alt="Remote Schema for Query" width="1000px" />

### Step 5.2: Add remote schema permissions

Remote Schema have role-based permissions, allowing you to expose only a certain part of the Remote Schema for the
selected role. You can choose to remove any fields from objects, interfaces and input object types. Doing this will
ensure that these fields are not exposed for the role and they will not be able to query the fields that have been
hidden. Follow along with this [document](/remote-schemas/auth/remote-schema-permissions.mdx) to add permissions for
Remote Schemas.

## Advanced topics

### Logging

Integrate [logging](/observability/overview.mdx) for gateway using Datadog, New Relic, Azure Monitor, Prometheus, or
OpenTelemetry. Navigate to Hasura cloud and, open the gateway project and, navigate the Integration tab to add the
logging service. These are available on Hasura's Professional tier.

### Enable rate limiting

Restricts number of GraphQL operations per minute. This uses a sliding window approach. This means whenever Hasura Pro
receives a request, it will count the rate of that client starting from the current time to last one minute. By default,
the rate-limit happens on the role_name i.e the value provided in `X-HASURA-ROLE`.

1. Navigate to the monitoring section on Hasura Console.
2. Click on `API Limits` and click on `security`.
3. Click on `Rate Limit` and set the values on `Request Rate Limit`.

### Adding relationship for remote schema.

Remote Schema to Remote Schema relationships (a.k.a GraphQL joins) extend the concept of joining data across tables, to
joining across remote GraphQL sources. Once you create relationships between types from the GraphQL schemas, you can
then "join" them by running GraphQL queries.

1. Head to the Remote Schema -> [remote-schema-name] -> Relationships tab.
2. Click the Add a new relationship button.
3. Define the relationship and hit Add Relationship.

## Conclusion

Hasura offers a powerful solution for creating a gateway for existing APIs. By leveraging Hasura's features, developers
can improve their API security, performance, and scalability, as well as streamline their development workflow.
