Introduction

This guide shows how to deploy the Hasura GraphQL engine on `Nhost <https://nhost.io>`__.

One-click deploy on Nhost
-------------------------

.. note::
   Make sure to `create an Nhost account <https://nhost.io/register>`__ first. Nhost offers a 30-day trial with its starter plan.

Once you're logged into your Nhost account, click the button bellow to configure your project.

The creation and provisioning of your backend should be ready in roughly 30 seconds. 
Your project has now a GraphQL API, a PostgreSQL database, user management, and storage for your files!

Access your Hasura console
--------------------------

Once your Nhost project is up and running, please go ahead and click on the ``Hasura`` option on the left menu.

The Hasura console endpoint is highlighted in red and has the following structure:

.. code-block:: bash

   https://<hasura-slug>.nhost.app/

To test it, you can either create tables directly using the console, or add new users to your project clicking on ``Auth`` on the left menu.

There is also a ``GraphQL API`` option for you to test the API.
Check out :ref:`making your first GraphQL query <first_graphql_query>` for more information.
