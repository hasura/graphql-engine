# Get Started with Docker (Hasura & MongoDB)

## Introduction

This guide will help you get set up with the [Enterprise Edition](/enterprise/overview.mdx) of Hasura GraphQL Engine
with our MongoDB integration using Docker Compose. This is the easiest way to set up Hasura Enterprise Edition and the
MongoDB GraphQL Data Connector.

:::info Supported versions:

Hasura GraphQL Engine `v2.27.0` onwards

:::

:::tip Supported features

Currently, Hasura supports read-only queries on MongoDB.<br/> Other limitations which are actively on the roadmap and
will be supported soon include:

- Embedded document queries and permissions.
- Cross-Collection relationships (executed within the database).
- Logical Models to support schema customization (removing the MongoDB validation schema as a dependency) and bespoke
  query execution.

:::

## Deploying Hasura Enterprise with Docker

### Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes that the following prerequisites have been met:

- You have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
  working on your machine.
- You have [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass) installed on your machine.

### Step 1: Get the Docker Compose file

The [install manifests](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/tree/master/install-manifests) repo contains all
installation manifests required to deploy Hasura anywhere. The Docker Compose manifest also contains a Postgres database
in order to store the Hasura metadata and a Redis instance for caching.

```bash
# in a new directory run
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hasura/graphql-engine/master/install-manifests/enterprise/mongodb/docker-compose.yaml
# or run
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hasura/graphql-engine/master/install-manifests/enterprise/mongodb/docker-compose.yaml -o docker-compose.yml
```

:::info Four containers are created

When you use these to launch the services, you'll see four containers running. The first two are Hasura GraphQL Engine
and a Postgres Database for storing Hasura's metadata. The third container is the MongoDB GraphQL Connector agent. The
forth container is a copy of [MongoDB Community Edition](https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo).

:::

### Step 2: Set the Hasura Enterprise Edition license key and the admin secret

Edit the downloaded `docker-compose.yaml` and set the license key and admin secret. If you've been provided a license
key by the Hasura team, you can enter it according to the directions below.

```yaml {5-6}
---
graphql-engine:
  image: hasura/graphql-engine:v2.27.0
  environment:
    HASURA_GRAPHQL_EE_LICENSE_KEY: <license key>
    HASURA_GRAPHQL_ADMIN_SECRET: <your secretkey>
```

An [admin secret key](/deployment/securing-graphql-endpoint.mdx) is required to make sure that your GraphQL endpoint and
the Hasura Console are not publicly accessible.

:::info I don't have a license key

If you don't already have a license key and are interested in trying out Hasura Enterprise Edition with MongoDB, you can
start a free 30-day trial. Leave the `HASURA_GRAPHQL_EE_LICENSE_KEY` environment variable commented out we'll return to
this in Step 6.

:::

:::caution Secure the admin secret

The `HASURA_GRAPHQL_ADMIN_SECRET` should never be passed from the client to the Hasura GraphQL Engine as it would give
the client full admin rights to your Hasura instance. See [Authentication & Authorization](/auth/overview.mdx) for
information on setting up auth in Hasura.

:::

### Step 3: Run the containers

The following command will create and run the containers in the Docker Compose manifest:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### Step 4: Create a MongoDB database

:::info I already have a MongoDB database

This guide assumes you don't have a MongoDB instance already set up. If you do, you can skip to
[Step 6](#step-6-load-the-hasura-console).

:::

Open MongoDB Compass and create a new connection using this connection string:

```
mongodb://mongouser:mongopassword@localhost:27017/?authMechanism=DEFAULT
```

Create a new database called demo using the MongoShell at the bottom of the MongoDB compass screen by entering the
command:

```
use demo;
```

Via MongoShell, create a new `users` collection:

```javascript
db.createCollection('users', {
  validator: {
    $jsonSchema: {
      bsonType: 'object',
      required: ['name', 'age'],
      properties: {
        name: {
          bsonType: 'string',
        },
        age: {
          bsonType: 'int',
          minimum: 18,
        },
        email: {
          bsonType: 'string',
          pattern: '^.+@.+$',
        },
        user_meta: {
          bsonType: 'object',
          properties: {
            user_role: {
              bsonType: 'string',
            },
            email_verified: {
              bsonType: 'bool',
            },
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
});
```

:::info Why do I need a validation schema in my Collection?

Currently, Hasura uses the validation schema to build your GraphQL schema.

Future versions of the Hasura MongoDB connector will allow on-the-fly editing of the GraphQL schema, will continue to
work with the MongoDB validation schema, but will not have it as a dependency.

Read more about the
[MongoDB validation schema](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/schema-validation/specify-json-schema/#std-label-schema-validation-json)
and how to set it up for your database.

:::

If you don't see your changes, you can refresh your databases on the left-hand sidebar. Once applied, you can view the
`users` Collection in MongoDB Compass:

<Thumbnail

  alt="Creating your first MongoDB Collection."
  width="1000px"
/>

### Step 5: Insert your first sample Documents

Insert a few sample documents to query on afterwards.

```javascript
db.users.insertMany([
  {
    name: 'John',
    age: 44,
    email: 'john@example.com',
    user_meta: {
      user_role: 'user',
      email_verified: true,
    },
  },
  {
    name: 'Jane',
    age: 24,
    email: 'jane@example.com',
    user_meta: {
      user_role: 'user',
      email_verified: true,
    },
  },
  {
    name: 'Emma',
    age: 36,
    email: 'emma@example.com',
    user_meta: {
      user_role: 'manager',
      email_verified: true,
    },
  },
  {
    name: 'Liam',
    age: 64,
    email: 'liam@example.com',
    user_meta: {
      user_role: 'manager',
      email_verified: true,
    },
  },
]);
```

You should see an output similar to this:

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/databases/mongodb/mongo-documents.png"
  alt="Inserting your sample Documents in MongoDB."
  width="1000px"
/>

### Step 6: Load the Hasura Console

Open the Hasura Console by navigating to `http://localhost:8080/console`. You will need to input your admin secret key
as set in your Docker Compose file to log in.

:::info 30-day free trial

If you don't already have a license key, you can start a 30-day free trial by clicking the `ENTERPRISE` button in the
top navigation. You can read more details [here](/enterprise/try-hasura-enterprise-edition.mdx).

/>

:::

### Step 7: Connect to MongoDB

Visit `Data` > `Manage` to connect your MongoDB database. **If you've connected using the Docker guide above, your
MongoDB data connector should be pre-connected to your Hasura instance.** Select the `Connect Database` button and
follow head to [Step 8](#step-8-tracking-collections).

You can check this by selecting the `Data Connector Agents` dropdown from the Data Manager:

If it is not connected and you're using the `docker-compose.yml` file above, you can use the following details to
connect to your agent as in the screenshot below:

- Agent Name: `mongodb`
- URL: `http://mongo-data-connector:3000`

Then click, `Connect`:

<Thumbnail src="/img/databases/mongodb/data-connector.png" alt="Connecting to MongoDB - Connector" width="1000px" />

Connect your database using the following details:

- Database Name: `mongodb`
- Connection: `mongodb://mongouser:mongopassword@mongodb:27017`
- db: `demo`

<Thumbnail src="/img/databases/mongodb/connecting.gif" alt="Connecting to MongoDB - Connections" width="1000px" />

If you're using a MongoDB instance hosted on MongoDB Atlas or elsewhere, simply add the connection details for your
instance and click `Connect Database`.

### Step 8: Tracking Collections

Once your database has been connected, select the database name from the left-hand sidebar.

You should see your `users` Collection listed here. Select it, and select `Track Selected`.

<Thumbnail src="/img/databases/mongodb/track-table.png" alt="Connecting to MongoDB - Track Tables." width="1000px" />

Your `users` Collection is now added to your GraphQL API! ðŸŽ‰

:::info Make your Collection available to other roles

By default, this Collection is only available to `admin` users. To make it available for more user groups, select the
Collection name from the left-hand sidebar, and select `Permissions` to setup permission rules for the Collection. You
can read more about permissions [here](/auth/authorization/index.mdx).

:::

### Step 9: Running your first query

Select API from your header, this will take you to GraphiQL, our API testing utility.

Entering the following query and running will return all your users:

```graphql
query allUsers {
  users {
    _id
    age
    email
    name
    user_meta {
      email_verified
      user_role
    }
  }
}
```

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/databases/mongodb/gql-query.png"
  alt="Connecting to MongoDB - Making a GraphQL query."
  width="1000px"
/>

Entering the following will only return users with the names 'John' or 'Jane':

```graphql
query userFiltered {
  users(where: { name: { _in: ["John", "Jane"] } }) {
    _id
    age
    email
    name
    user_meta {
      email_verified
      user_role
    }
  }
}
```
