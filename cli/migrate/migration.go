// NewMigration returns a new Migration and sets the body, identifier,
// version and targetVersion. Body can be nil, which turns this migration
// into a "NilMigration". If no identifier is provided, it will default to "<empty>".
// targetVersion can be -1, implying it is a NilVersion.
//
// What is a NilMigration?
// Usually each migration version coming from source is expected to have an
// Up and Down migration. This is not a hard requirement though, leading to
// a situation where only the Up or Down migration is present. So let's say
// the user wants to migrate up to a version that doesn't have the actual Up
// migration, in that case we still want to apply the version, but with an empty
// body. We are calling that a NilMigration, a migration with an empty body.
//
// What is a NilVersion?
// NilVersion is a const(-1). When running down migrations and we are at the
// last down migration, there is no next down migration, the targetVersion should
// be nil. Nil in this case is represented by -1 (because type int).
