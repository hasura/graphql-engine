# Troubleshooting Hasura GraphQL engine errors

## Introduction

This section provides references that can help in troubleshooting errors
when developing with Hasura.

## Logs

In order to find out about the origins of an error, it can be helpful to
check the logs.

:::info Metrics and distributed tracing in Hasura Cloud

Hasura Cloud includes metrics and distributed tracing which makes
troubleshooting faster. For more information, see [Metrics](/graphql/cloud/metrics/index.mdx) 
and [Tracing](/graphql/cloud/tracing.mdx) in Hasura Cloud.

### Server logs

For errors that come from the Hasura server, server logs will give you
more insights. For details on how you can access these logs, as well as
different log types, visit [this page](/graphql/core/deployment/logging.mdx).

### Console logs

Should there be any error coming from the Hasura console UI, they will
show up in the Browser dev tools.

### Remote service logs

Errors can come from a remote service, such as
[remote schemas](/graphql/core/remote-schemas/index.mdx), [events](/graphql/core/event-triggers/index.mdx) or
[actions](/graphql/core/actions/index.mdx). In this case, check the errors of the respective
remote service. For actions, check out this [debugging page](/graphql/core/actions/debugging.mdx).
