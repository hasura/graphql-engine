# Get Started with Docker (Hasura & ClickHouse)

Testing is currently underway on the ClickHouse connector for use in self-hosted environments. Our suggested
installation method is to use Docker Compose to deploy a working instance of Hasura with the ClickHouse Connector
enabled.

In order to do this, follow the instructions for
[Hasura Enterprise Edition](/enterprise/getting-started/quickstart-docker.mdx), but change out the Docker Compose files
listed in that documentation to these values:

```bash
# in a new directory run
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hasura/graphql-engine/master/install-manifests/enterprise/clickhouse/docker-compose.yaml
# or run
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hasura/graphql-engine/master/install-manifests/enterprise/clickhouse/docker-compose.yaml -o docker-compose.yml
```

When you use these to launch the services, you'll see three containers running instead of two. The third container is
the ClickHouse GraphQL Connector agent. By navigating to the Hasura Console after execution, you'll find the ClickHouse
data source as a type that can now be added to your Hasura GraphQL Service instance.

You can check the health of the connector using the `/health` endpoint. The connector is available at the following
endpoint:

```bash
http://localhost:8080/health
```

You can follow the instructions from
[this step](/databases/clickhouse/getting-started/cloud.mdx#step-22-next-choose-the-clickhouse-driver) onward to connect
to your ClickHouse instance and begin using it with Hasura.

## Keep up to date

:::info Note

Currently, Hasura supports read-only queries, relationships, and permissions on ClickHouse. Column comparison operators
are not supported with permissions on ClickHouse.

Please watch this space to get the latest docs on how you can try these features out via the Console or by manipulating
Metadata in JSON/YAML directly.
