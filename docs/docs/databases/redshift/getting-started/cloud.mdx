# Get Started with Hasura Cloud and Amazon Redshift

## Introduction

### Step 1: Create an account on Hasura Cloud and create a new Hasura Project

Navigate to
[cloud.hasura.io](https://cloud.hasura.io/signup/?pg=docs&plcmt=body&cta=navigate-to-cloud-hasura-io&tech=default&skip_onboarding=true),
and create a new Hasura Cloud account.

Once you create a project on Hasura Cloud, hit the "Launch Console" button to open the Hasura Console for your project.

### Step 2: Add your Amazon Redshift database as a source to Hasura

Head to the `Data > Manage databases` section on the Console to add your Amazon Redshift database as a source to Hasura.

:::info Make sure your Amazon Redshift service is reachable by Hasura Cloud:

1.  **Allow public connections or
    [whitelist the Hasura Cloud IP](/hasura-cloud/projects/create.mdx#cloud-projects-create-allow-nat-ip) on your Amazon
    Redshift firewall:** This is good for testing and will allow you to quickly try Hasura out with your database!
2.  **VPC peering:** VPC peering and private network access is available on Hasura Cloud paid tiers: Recommended for
    production. Get in touch with us if you'd like to try this out against your existing databases!

:::

First, we need to add the redshift agent:

Now we need to connect to Redshift by clicking `Connect Database`:

Next, choose the `redshift (Beta)` driver:

  alt="Adding the Amazon Redshift service"
  width="1000px"
/>

Finally, enter your Amazon Redshift database URL and
[database schema](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/creating-tables.html) and click `Connect Database`:

<Thumbnail

  alt="Setting the Amazon Redshift connection details."
  width="1000px"
/>

Once you add the Amazon Redshift service, you'll see it listed as an available database on the sidebar.

### Step 3: Track existing tables

To query against your Amazon Redshift service using Hasura, you'll need to have existing tables to select. Those tables
will appear under the database as shown.

Track tables selectively or all so that Hasura can introspect the tables and create the corresponding GraphQL schema.
Once you've selected the tables you'd like to track, click `Track Selected` to finish setup:

### Step 4: Try out a GraphQL query

Head to the `API` tab in the Console and try running a GraphQL query! Use the explorer sidebar on GraphQL to get help in
creating a GraphQL query.
