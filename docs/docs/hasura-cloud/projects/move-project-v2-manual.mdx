# Manually Move Hasura Cloud v1.3 Projects to Hasura v2.0

<ProductBadge free pro ee />

## Introduction

Hasura Cloud now creates new projects with Hasura `v2.0` by default. Due to some underlying architectural changes in
`v2.0`, existing projects have not yet been upgraded to `v2.0`.

In the meanwhile it is possible to manually "move" your project to use Hasura `v2.0`. You will lose any scheduled events
and the history of your processed events and async actions in the process though.

Do check the [changelog](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/releases) first to see what changes and features have
been introduced.

## Move existing v1.3 project to a v2.0 project

As it is not possible to actually upgrade your `v1.3` project to `v2.0`, you will have to essentially create a new
Hasura Project with `v2.0` and connect it with your database with the same Hasura Metadata as in the previous project.

### Step 1: Export Metadata from existing project

See [exporting metadata](/migrations-metadata-seeds/manage-metadata.mdx) to get a copy of the current Hasura Metadata on
your project.

Do ensure no further changes are made to the Hasura Metadata post this.

### Step 2: Create a v2.0 Cloud project

See `Step 1` of [creating projects](/hasura-cloud/projects/create.mdx) to create a new Hasura Cloud `v2.0` project.

### Step 3: Connect your database with the name **default** to the new project

See `Step 2` of [creating projects](/hasura-cloud/projects/create.mdx) to connect your existing database to the new
project. Please ensure you set the database name as `default`.

:::info Note

After connecting a database to a `v2.0` project it will not be usable with a `v1.3` project. Hence it is recommended to
stop your `v1.3` project before doing this.

:::

### Step 4: Apply the exported Metadata to the new project

See [applying metadata](/migrations-metadata-seeds/manage-metadata.mdx) to apply the earlier exported Metadata to the
new project.

Your GraphQL API should now be regenerated as in the earlier `v1.3` project.
