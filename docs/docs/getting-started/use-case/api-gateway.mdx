# Build an API gateway

## Overview

This guide, and the others contained in this directory, are intended to be a step-by-step resource to build an
application using Hasura. If you arrived here from the Hasura Cloud Console, you'll have already created a project and
are ready to follow the steps below. If you're here from elsewhere, you can create a
[Hasura Cloud project](https://cloud.hasura.io?skip_onboarding=true) for free and get started right away.

### What we're building

<Thumbnail src="/img/use-case-overview/api-gateway.svg" alt="Hasura API Gateway overview" width="600px" />

The application we will be building is an API gateway that unifies multiple GraphQL APIs into one. While we'll focus on
integrating a payment processor, a social networking API, and a CMS, the concepts and techniques we will be using apply
to any application seeking to unify multiple GraphQL APIs.

This can be a daunting task for developers and systems architects. It requires a deep understanding of the different
APIs, their schemas, and how they can be combined in a way that makes sense for the end user. However, with Hasura, this
process can be streamlined and simplified. Hasura allows you to bring in many GraphQL APIs and turn them into one,
eliminating the need for complex integration work. With Hasura, you can focus on creating a powerful and intuitive API
gateway that delivers a seamless experience to end users.

In the example below, we're mimicking a scenario wherein an application is reliant on three APIs to deliver a single
experience to its users end users. The first is a social networking API that allows users to create accounts, follow
other users, and make comments on their posts. The second API is a payment processor that allows administrators to
create products and accept payments. Finally, we have a CMS that allows users to create and edit content. As you stitch
together these three APIs, you will be able to create a powerful API gateway that allows users to query information
about their accounts and network, see their orders, and manage content — all seamlessly from a single, easy-to-manage
endpoint.

By the end of this guide, you'll have an API gateway that you can translate into your own application.

## Fully-functional gateway

Steps 1 through 5 will cover everything needed to create a fully-functional API gateway.

### Step 1. Connect the APIs

In the modern era of building applications, it's common to rely on multiple APIs. Each of these APIs typically has its
own schema, which can make it difficult to stitch them together into a single, simple-to-use API for your teams. Hasura
can help you unify these APIs into a single API that can be accessed by your application. And, you can do this by simply
pasting in a few URLs.

To save you time, we've generated three **read-only** GraphQL APIs for you to use in this guide:

| API        | Description                                                                           | URL                                              |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `socials`  | Allows users to create accounts, follow other users, and make comments on their posts | `https://growth-gateway-1.hasura.app/v1/graphql` |
| `payments` | Allows administrators to create products and accept payments                          | `https://growth-gateway-2.hasura.app/v1/graphql` |
| `CMS`      | Allows users to create and edit content                                               | `https://growth-gateway-3.hasura.app/v1/graphql` |

We call these GraphQL APIs **Remote Schemas** because they are not hosted on the same server as your Hasura instance. To
connect to these, head to the `Remote Schemas` tab of your **Hasura Console** - the UI that allows you to interact with
your Hasura instance - and click `Add`:

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/resources/use-case/api-gateway/remote-schemas-add.png"
  alt="Add a Remote Schema in the Hasura Console"
  width="1000px"
/>

We'll give the first Remote Schema the name of `socials` and paste in this URL before clicking `Add Remote Schema`:

```
https://growth-gateway-1.hasura.app/v1/graphql
```

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/resources/use-case/api-gateway/connect-social-networking.png"
  alt="Connect to the social networking API"
  width="1000px"
/>

Repeat this process for the other two APIs by clicking `Add` in the sidebar and naming them based on the table above,
before pasting in the URLs. Once complete, your Remote Schemas should look like this:

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/resources/use-case/api-gateway/all-schemas-added.png"
  alt="All Remote Schemas added to the Hasura Console"
  width="1000px"
/>

:::info You've got an API gateway!

That's it?! Yes, that's it! You've just created an API gateway that unifies three GraphQL APIs into one. You can now
execute a myriad of GraphQL operations across all three APIs. However, we can do better. Let's take a look at what we
can do to make this API gateway even more powerful and simple to use for your teams.

:::

### Step 2. Customize your schema

If we head over to the `API` tab of our the Console and take a look at the root-level fields of our API, we can see that
we have a lot:

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/resources/use-case/api-gateway/fields-before-customization.png"
  alt="The root-level fields of our API before customization"
  width="1000px"
/>

These APIs are relatively simple, so you can imagine how much more overwhelming it would be if you had your own,
production-grade set of APIs. This can make it difficult for your teams to understand which fields are available and how
they can be used.

Not to worry. Hasura can help us simplify this by allowing us to customize the root-level fields of our API. This means
that we can add a namespace to each API, keeping each set of fields organized.

To do this, head back to the `Remote Schemas` tab of the Console and choose our `CMS` Remote Schema from the side bar.
Then, click `Modify` and head down to the `GraphQL Customizations` section. If you click `Edit` here, you'll be able to
add a `Root Field Namespace` to each of the fields. After adding `cms` to the first field, click `Save`:

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/resources/use-case/api-gateway/prefixing-root-fields.png"
  alt="Prefixing root fields with a namespace"
  width="1000px"
/>

Repeat this process for the other two APIs, adding `payments` and `socials` as the namespace for each. Once complete,
head back to your `API` tab and take a look at the root-level fields of your API. You should now see that each field has
been consolidated into a single namespace:

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/resources/use-case/api-gateway/consolidated-fields.png"
  alt="Consolidated fields in the API tab after adding namespaces"
  width="1000px"
/>

:::info Schema customization

Hasura allows you to customize your schema even further! You can add custom fields, change the names of fields, and even
add custom types.

:::

### Step 3. Create relationships & query across APIs

It's great that we have an easy-to-navigate, unified API, but it'd be nice if we could query across the three APIs. For
example, we might want to query for a user's posts and the comments that have been made on those posts. This is where
relationships come in.

Since our `CMS` API has a `posts` table with a `user_id` column, we can create a relationship between the `CMS` API and
the `socials` API. To do this, we'll need to head to the `Remote Schemas` tab, select the `socials` API from the side
bar, click `Relationships`, and then `Add a new relationship`:

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/resources/use-case/api-gateway/add-new-relationship.png"
  alt="Adding a new relationship between the CMS and socials APIs"
  width="1000px"
/>

We'll give the relationship the name of `posts` and a Source Type of `users` while referencing the `CMS` Remote Schema:

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/resources/use-case/api-gateway/schema-mapping.png"
  alt="Mapping the schema of the CMS API to the socials API"
  width="1000px"
/>

Next, expand the `Query` option and add a `where` clause for `user_id` to be equal to `id` of the `users` table:

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/resources/use-case/api-gateway/query-details-socials-posts-mapping.png"
  alt="Mapping the query details for the socials API"
  width="1000px"
/>

Finally, click `Add Relationship`. We can now query across the two APIs! If you head back to your `API` tab, you can try
running this query:

```graphql
query AllUsersAndPosts {
  socials {
    users {
      id
      username
      posts {
        id
        title
      }
    }
  }
}
```

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/resources/use-case/api-gateway/all-users-and-posts-query.png"
  alt="Querying across two APIs using a relationship"
  width="1000px"
/>

### Step 4. Connect all three

Suppose we have a dashboard that we want to display to our users. This dashboard might include a user's posts, the
comments that have been made on those posts, and the products that the user has purchased. We can do this by writing a
single query across all three APIs.

To do this, we'll need to create a relationship between the `socials` API and the `payments` API. Head over to the
`Remote Schemas` tab of the Console and select the `socials` API from the side bar. Then, click `Relationships` and
`Add a new relationship` just as before.

In the `users` table of our `socials` API, we store the email address of each user; in our `payments` API, we store the
email address of each order in a field called `customer_email`. We can use this to create a relationship between the two
APIs.

We'll give the relationship the name of `orders` and a Source Type of `users` while referencing the `payments` Remote
Schema:

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/resources/use-case/api-gateway/add-orders-relationship.png"
  alt="Adding a new relationship between the socials and payments APIs"
  width="1000px"
/>

Next, expand the `Query` option and add a `where` clause for `customer_email` to be equal to `email` of the `users`
table:

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/resources/use-case/api-gateway/schema-mapping-orders.png"
  alt="Mapping the schema of the payments API to the socials API"
  width="1000px"
/>

Finally, click `Add Relationship`. We can now query across all three APIs! If you run the following query in the `API`
tab, you should see results similar to what's below:

<GraphiQLIDE
  query={`query UserDashboard($id: Int!) {
  socials {
    users(where: {id: {_eq: $id}}) {
      id
      username
      orders {
        id
        product {
          name
        }
      }
      posts {
        title
      }
    }
  }
}`}
  variables={`{"id": 1}`}
  response={`{
  "data": {
    "socials": {
      "users": [
        {
          "id": 1,
          "username": "user1",
          "orders": [
            {
              "id": 1,
              "product": {
                "name": "iPhone 13 Pro"
              }
            },
            {
              "id": 3,
              "product": {
                "name": "Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra"
              }
            },
            {
              "id": 5,
              "product": {
                "name": "Sony Alpha a7 III"
              }
            },
            {
              "id": 8,
              "product": {
                "name": "iPad Pro"
              }
            }
          ],
          "posts": [
            {
              "title": "Post 1 Title"
            },
            {
              "title": "Post 3 Title"
            },
            {
              "title": "Post 5 Title"
            },
            {
              "title": "Post 7 Title"
            },
            {
              "title": "Post 9 Title"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}`}
/>

### Step 5. Add authorization

With our current setup, anyone can query our API. This is fine for some use cases, but we might want to add
authorization to our API. For example, we might want to restrict access to the `users` table of our `socials` API so
that only the user who owns the account can query their own data. We can do this by adding **permissions** to our Remote
Schemas.

To do this, we first need to set an environment variable for our project. In Hasura Cloud, your environment variables
are controlled via the project's settings. You can reach these by clicking on the name of your project in the top-right
corner of the Console. Then, click on the `Env vars` in the project's sidebar and `+ New Env Var` before entering
`HASURA_GRAPHQL_ENABLE_REMOTE_SCHEMA_PERMISSIONS` and setting its value to `true`:

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/resources/use-case/api-gateway/enable-rs-permissions.png"
  alt="Enabling Remote Schema permissions"
  width="1000px"
/>

Click `Add` and then head back to your project's Console. In the `Remote Schemas` tab, select the `socials` API from the
side bar and click `Permissions`. Here, we'll enter a new role called `user` and click on the ❌ icon to edit the
permissions:

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/resources/use-case/api-gateway/create-user-role.png"
  alt="Creating a new role for the socials API"
  width="1000px"
/>

Click `type query_root` and check `users`, then click `where` and choose `id` -> `_eq` and enter `X-Hasura-User-Id`:

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/resources/use-case/api-gateway/set-user-permissions.png"
  alt="Setting permissions for the user role"
  width="1000px"
/>

As our `users` table has a number of relationships, we'll need to allow access to those as well. Check the boxes for
each of the remaining tables highlighted below:

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/resources/use-case/api-gateway/user-permissions-details.png"
  alt="Details of the user role permissions"
  width="1000px"
/>

Then, click `Save Permissions` at the bottom of the page.

Head back to the `API` tab where we're going to add a couple of new headers. First, we'll add `x-hasura-user-id` and set
its value to `1`. Then, we'll add a second header called `x-hasura-role` which is set to `user`:

<Thumbnail src="/img/resources/use-case/api-gateway/headers.png" alt="Adding headers to the API tab" width="1000px" />

Hopefully you noticed something change. The `socials` namespace is now the only visible portion of our schema. This is
because we've created a role of `user` and only given it access to the `users` table of the `socials` API. By including
this header, the GraphiQL Explorer reflects the schema available to a user with the role of `user`.

If we run this query, we'll see that we only get back the data for the user with an `id` of `1`:

```graphql
query UserInfo {
  socials {
    users {
      id
      email
      username
    }
  }
}
```

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/resources/use-case/api-gateway/user-query-with-permissions.png"
  alt="User query with permissions"
  width="1000px"
/>

:::info Learn more about authentication and authorization

Hasura is agnostic about how you authenticate your users. You can use any authentication provider you like, including
Auth0, Firebase, or even your own custom solution. You can learn more about authentication and authorization in Hasura
in the [docs](/auth/overview.mdx).

If you want to see more details about handling Remote Schema permissions, check out
[this page](/remote-schemas/auth/remote-schema-permissions.mdx).

:::

If you've reached this point and followed along with everything, you should be proud! You've just created an API gateway
with Hasura that can act as a single endpoint for all your different GraphQL services. You can now use this API to build
your frontend and focus on what matters most - building your product. 🎉

## Enhanced capabilities

While everything covered above is enough to get you up and running with a gateway, Hasura has a number of enhanced
capabilities that can help you build an ever more robust API gateway. In this section, we'll cover some of the most
common use-cases and how you can use Hasura to solve them. We'll also provide links to more in-depth documentation so
you can learn more.

### Step 6. Hide fields

One added bonus of using Hasura as an API gateway is that you can hide fields from your underlying services. For
example, if you wanted to hide the `email` field from the `users` table of the `socials` API, you could do so with just
a few clicks.

<Player src="/img/resources/use-case/api-gateway/hide-fields.webm" />

<details>
  <summary>Show me how to do this</summary>
  <div>

Head back to the `Permissions` tab of the `socials` API under `Remote Schemas`. Then, find `email` in the list of fields
and un-check it. Click `Save Permissions` and then head back to the `API` tab. You should now see that the `email` field
is no longer visible in the GraphiQL Explorer.

  </div>
</details>

### Step 7. Monitor the gateway

When you're responsible for a production API, you need to be able to monitor it. You need to know when it's up, when
it's down, and when it's slow. You need to know when errors are happening and what those errors are. You need to know
when your API is being used and how it's being used. You need to know when your API is being abused and how it's being
abused.

With Hasura, you can monitor your API with ease. Hasura provides a number of observability tools out of the box and
integrates with popular third-party services like Datadog, Prometheus, and any other service that supports
OpenTelemetry.

<Player src="/img/resources/use-case/api-gateway/o11y.webm" />

:::info Learn more about monitoring

Observability tools are available on our [Cloud Professional](/hasura-cloud/overview.mdx#cloud-professional),
[Cloud Enterprise](/hasura-cloud/overview.mdx#cloud-enterprise), and [Self-hosted Enterprise](/enterprise/overview.mdx)
plans. You can learn more about observability in Hasura in the [docs](/observability/overview.mdx).
