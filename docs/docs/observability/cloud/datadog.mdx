# Datadog Integration on Hasura Cloud

<ProductBadge pro ee />

## Introduction

You can export metrics, operation logs and traces of your Hasura Cloud project to your organization's Datadog dashboard.
This can be configured on the integrations tab on the project's setting page.

:::info Note

For Hasura Cloud projects, the Datadog Integration is only available on the `Standard` (pay-as-you-go) tier and above.

:::

:::tip More metrics on OpenTelemetry exporter

Try the new [OpenTelemetry exporter](/observability/opentelemetry.mdx) to get advanced metrics and traces to connect
with Datadog. This integration will export the metrics as detailed [here](#view-metrics).

:::

## Configure Datadog integration

Navigate to the integrations tab on project settings page to find Datadog integration.

<Thumbnail src="/img/observability/integrate-datadog.png" alt="Configure Datadog Integration" width="1146px" />

Select the Datadog API region and enter the Datadog API key (can be retrieved by navigating to Datadog's settings page
by clicking the `Get API Key` link), host, service name and tags to associate with exported logs, metrics and traces.

| Field        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Region       | Hasura supports all available Datadog regions, namely US1, US3, US5, EU, US1FED.                                                                                                                                                  |
| API Key      | API keys are unique to your organization. An API key is required by the Datadog agent to submit metrics and events to Datadog. Click on `Read more` above the `API Key` field in the Datadog integration form to get the API key. |
| Host         | The name of the originating host of the log and metrics.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Tags         | Tags associated with your logs and metrics. Default tags `project_id` and `project_name` are exported with all logs and metrics. A source tag `hasura-cloud-metrics` is added to all exported logs.                               |
| Service Name | The name of the application or service generating the log events.                                                                                                                                                                 |

After adding appropriate values, click `Save`.

## Checking the status of the integration

The green/red dot signifies the status of the integration. Green signifies successful exporting of logs to datadog. When
logs are successfully exported, `Last Exported` is continuously updated, indicating the timestamp of the last log line
successfully exported to your Datadog dashboard.

  width="1146px"
/>

In case there is an error while exporting logs to datadog, the dot is red and the HTTP status code of the error is
displayed right below it.

## View logs

The logs can be viewed in your Datadog dashboard, under the `Logs` tab. To navigate to the same, click `View Logs`.

<Thumbnail

  alt="Datadog Integration successfully configured"
  width="1146px"
/>

<Thumbnail src="/img/observability/datadog-logs.png" alt="Logs successfully exported to Datadog" width="1146px" />

To view only logs exported by Hasura Cloud, filter your logs using `host` and/or `tags` you configured with this
integration.

:::info Note

Datadog allows ingestion of logs with maximum size 256kB for a single log. If a log exceeds this limit, Datadog will
truncate the log at 256kB.

:::

## View metrics

The integration exports the following five metrics to your Datadog dashboard:

| Metric Exported                | Metric Name in Datadog        |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Average number of requests     | `average_requests_per_minute` |
| Average request execution time | `average_execution_time`      |
| Success rate of requests       | `success_rate`                |
| Active subscriptions           | `active_subscriptions`        |
| Number of websockets open      | `websockets_open`             |

Non zero values of all the above metrics are exported over a one minute time interval. Each metric name is prefixed with
`hasura_cloud`.

Graphs for all the above metrics can be viewed in your Datadog dashboard, under the `Metrics` tab. To navigate to the
same, click `View Metrics`.

Select the graphs you want to view from the metrics explorer. Alternatively, select the `host` you configured with this
integration to see all the graphs corresponding to metrics exported by Hasura Cloud.

## View traces

Along with the logs and metrics, query tracing is exported to Datadog. From your Datadog metrics page, `APM` > `Traces`
will show you a live search of ingested trace data, with each entry of the output table showing the duration of the
operation.

Clicking on an entry from the table will show the details about the trace, including a flame graph, which contains a
visual representation of where the operation spent its execution over time. For example, in this case a query took 2.31
milliseconds in total, of which 758 microseconds was the actual Postgres database processing the query.
