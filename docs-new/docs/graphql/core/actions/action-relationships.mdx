# Actions relationships

## Introduction

Actions are a way to extend your GraphQL schema with custom queries or
mutations. It is quite a typical case that an action's response is
actually related to existing objects in the schema and the action needs
to be connected with the rest of the graph.

For example, a custom `insertAuthor` action will be related to the
`author` object in the schema. Hence, we would want to be able to get
information about the `author` from the graph as a response of the
`insertAuthor` mutation.

## Using action output type's relationships

Actions can be connected to the rest of the graph by setting up
relationships on its return output type.

This allows complex responses to be returned as an action's response
traversing the graph via the output type's relationships.

**For example**, given the action:

```graphql
type Mutation {
  updateAuthor (
    id: Int!
    name: String!
  ): UpdateAuthorOutput
}

type UpdateAuthorOutput {
   author_id : Int!
}
```

We can create an object relationship called `updatedAuthor` between the
`UpdateAuthorOutput` object type and the `author` table using the
`UpdateAuthorOutput.author_id` and `author.id` fields.

The object type will now be modified as:

```graphql {3}
type UpdateAuthorOutput {
   author_id : Int!
   updatedAuthor: author
}
```

Now we can make a mutation request with a complex response such as:

```graphql
mutation updateAuthorAndGetArticles($id: Int, $name: String) {
  updateAuthor(id: $id, name: $name) {
    author_id
    updatedAuthor {
      id
      name
      articles {
        id
        title
      }
    }
  }
}
```

See more details at [custom object type relationships](/graphql/core/actions/types.mdx)

### Creating relationships for custom object types

You can create relationships for custom output types by:

<Tabs className="api-tabs">
<TabItem value="console" label="Console">

Head to the `Actions -> [action-name] -> Relationships` tab in the
console for the action returning the output type.

Set the output type relationship as shown below:

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/graphql/core/actions/actions-relationship.png"
  alt="Console action relationship"
/>

Hit `Save` to create the relationship.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

Go to `metadata/actions.yaml` in the Hasura project directory.

Update the definition of the `UpdateAuthorOutput` object type as:

```yaml  {4-11}
- custom_types
  - objects
    - name: UpdateAuthorOutput
      relationships:
      - name: updatedAuthor
        type: object
        remote_table:
          schema: public
          name: author
        field_mapping:
          author_id: id
```

Save the changes and run `hasura metadata apply` to create the relationship.
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="api" label="API">

Action relationships can be added while defining custom types via the
[set_custom_types](/graphql/core/api-reference/metadata-api/custom-types.mdx#metadata-set-custom-types) metadata API:

```http {20-29}
POST /v1/metadata HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
X-Hasura-Role: admin

{
  "type": "set_custom_types",
  "args": {
    "scalars": [],
    "enums": [],
    "input_objects": [],
    "objects": [
      {
        "name": "UpdateAuthorOutput",
        "fields": [
          {
            "name": "author_id",
            "type": "Int!"
          }
        ],
        "relationships": [
          {
            "name": "updatedAuthor",
            "type": "object",
            "remote_table": "author",
            "field_mapping": {
              "author_id": "id"
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
