# Building a Data API on existing data sources with Hasura

## Introduction

Hasura connects to your databases, REST endpoints and GraphQL endpoints to instantly provide a scalable, highly
available, globally distributed, fully managed, secure GraphQL API as a service!

Let's break the above statement down.

As data is no longer in a single data-source, without Hasura you have to build an API that is able to connect to
multiple data-sources, absorb some domain-specific logic, and provide the required security and performance/concurrency.
This process is time consuming and hard to get right.

Instead of spending months writing code to map thousands of tables, embed authorization rules and building APIs, Hasura
allows developers to declaratively configure a web-server in minutes and expose a production-ready API. From building
something by hand to getting that “as a service”.

Take a look at this diagram to understand where Hasura fits in your product.

Hasura also supports many advanced features like authentication, caching, security, monitoring, streaming subscriptions,
running async code on database events, federating data from multiple data sources, REST endpoints and other GraphQL
schemas to build a unified api, and much more.

<br />

## Step 1: Connect a Database

Let's get started by adding your first database to Hasura!

:::info Note

We will be using the Hasura Console in the next few steps, which is a web app to set up Hasura by just making some
clicks! If you landed on this doc and do not have the Hasura console open, we recommend you to go through one of the
quickstart guides [here](/getting-started/overview.mdx) first.

Also assuming that you are connecting to an already running Postgres database instance. The steps are going to be the
same for other databases for the most part. But if required, you can reference [this](/databases/overview.mdx) section
if you are stuck.

:::

1. In your Hasura Console, navigate to the `Data` tab in the top navbar.
2. Click on `Connect Database` button and enter your Postgres database connection string. You can enter the connection
   string directly in the `Database URL` input section. (If you are using a different data source, you can select it via
   `Data Source Driver` dropdown).
3. Once done, click on `Connect Database`.

This should add the database and there should be a notification. You can select `View Database` in the notification to
view you database.

<Player
  src="/img/getting-started/hasura-use-case/data-api-connect-db.webm"
  showControls
  autoPlay={false}
  loop={false}
/>

## Step 2: Track tables/relationships

After adding the database, you will see a list of all the tables that you have under the database schemas. Tables can be
present in the underlying Postgres database without being exposed over the GraphQL API. In order to expose a table over
the GraphQL API, it needs to be tracked.

You can track your tables by hitting the `Track All` button, or track some of them selectively.

<Player
  src="/img/getting-started/hasura-use-case/data-api-track-tables.webm"
  showControls
  autoPlay={false}
  loop={false}
/>

As soon as a table is tracked, the corresponding GraphQL schema types and query/mutation/subscription fields will be
automatically generated. These auto-generated fields will allow you to query and mutate data in the table.

Before querying, let's add some relationships. You might have some foreign key relationships in your database tables. We
need to tell hasura to use those relationships, or any other custom relationships and include in the GraphQL API. Using
these relationships, you can then make nested queries. All this will be super clear when we start making queries. But
let's first add some relationships.

1. Once you track a table, go to the table using the left sidebar.
2. Go to `Relationships` tab.
3. Hasura should be auto suggesting some relationships if you have foreign keys set on the table. Add one of the
   suggested relationship.

In the example below, I have a schema for a slack like group chat app with users, channels, and workspaces. I'll now add
a relationship `channel_member` in users table.

<Player
  src="/img/getting-started/hasura-use-case/data-api-set-relationship.webm"
  showControls
  autoPlay={false}
  loop={false}
/>

## Step 3: Explore GraphQL API

That was it! We got an instant Graphql API on your data already. The Hasura GraphQL Engine automatically generates
GraphQL query/mutation/subscription fields for inserting, updating, deleting or streaming data based on your database's
schema. For any tracked table, a set of queries/mutations/subscriptions are generated and exposed as part of the GraphQL
API.

### Step 3.1: Query the data

With the Hasura GraphQL Engine, you get powerful, full-coverage queries right out of the box. As soon as you connect
your database, you'll be able to query all your related and deeply nested data easily with the power of GraphQL. You'll
also be able to aggregate, filter, sort, and paginate results. Let's make our first query!

1. On the Hasura Console, navigate to `API` tab in the top navbar. API tab is a playground or say a client, where you
   can test your query/mutation/subscription responses.
2. You should be able to see your schema tables in the left navbar.
3. Build a GraphQL Query. GraphQL queries are nested queries in which we ask exactly what data we need.

An example query would look something like this. Here I'm querying the users and the `channel_members` info that the
user is related to. Querying channel members is possible due to the relationship we added in the above step:

```graphql
query GetUsers {
  users {
    name
    phone_number
    channel_members {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

<Player
  src="/img/getting-started/hasura-use-case/data-api-make-query.webm"
  showControls
  autoPlay={false}
  loop={false}
/>

### Step 3.2: Make a mutation

The Hasura GraphQL Engine automatically generates GraphQL mutation fields for inserting, updating, or deleting data
based on your database's schema. For any tracked table, a set of mutations are generated and exposed as part of the
GraphQL API. Let's make our first mutation!

1. On the API tab, select `mutation` from the `Add New` dropdown at the bottom, and click on the plus icon.
2. You should be able to see some autogenerated mutations on your schema. Build a mutation using the explorer on left
   navbar, and hit the play button.

For example, I'm inserting a user in my user table in the gif below. The mutation looks like this:

```graphql
mutation AddUser {
  insert_users(objects: { email: "jhondoe@gmail.com", name: "John Doe", password: "secretPassword" }) {
    affected_rows
  }
}
```

<Player
  src="/img/getting-started/hasura-use-case/data-api-make-mutation.webm"
  showControls
  autoPlay={false}
  loop={false}
/>

### Step 3.3: Make a subscription

Subscriptions enable you to push data from your database to your clients in real-time, making them a powerful tool for
building reactive applications without the need for continuous server polling. Let's make a subscription now!

For making a subscription, I'll continue using the same example. I have an `online_users` view which checks tells if a
user is online by checking the last seen of the user. We will subscribe to this view, and when we add a new user, we
should see the subscription push the data of the new user in real time!

1. Let's add a subscription by selecting the `Subscription` option from the `Add New` dropdown. My subscription looks
   like this:

```graphql
subscription MySubscription {
  online_users {
    id
    last_seen
  }
}
```

2. Next I'll open my same hasura project in a new tab, and use the `API` explorer to add a mutation to insert a new
   user. Then, in the previous tab, I should be able to see the data of the inserted user in real time.

```graphql
mutation MyMutation {
  insert_users(
    objects: { email: "jhondoe@gmail.com", last_seen: "now()", name: "John Doe", password: "secretPassword" }
  ) {
    affected_rows
    returning {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

<Player
  src="/img/getting-started/hasura-use-case/data-api-subscription.webm"
  showControls
  autoPlay={false}
  loop={false}
/>

## Step 4: Add Authorization

:::info Note

As auth is a complex topic, we assume you have some prior knowledge of how it works. Otherwise just ride along and use
the link at the bottom to read more about auth with Hasura.

:::

Authentication verifies the identity of a user or service, and authorization determines their access rights to the
service. The basic premise here is this:

- There might be some publicly available information in your app (for example public channels in a group chat app that
  anyone can access without signing in). This information won't need any auth.
- There might be some user specific information in your app, that only the user should be able to see (for example a
  user's address information). This information will only be accessible to user if the users sends some info with the
  request telling Hasura about their identity.

For working with the user specific information, users need to be authenticated. Actual authentication is handled outside
Hasura. So you need to either have a custom auth service, or use one of the auth providers (like Auth0). Once a user is
authenticated with your auth service, you can either provide a JWT to the Hasura GraphQL Engine containing session
variables like user role, or specify a webhook in order to fetch the session variables on each request.

For authorization, Hasura helps you define granular, role and session variable based permission rules to control access
to your data. These permissions utilize the session variables returned by your authentication service and are granular
enough to control access to every row or column in your database.

Let's take a look at a high-level overview of how this works when Hasura GraphQL Engine receives a request:

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/auth/auth-high-level-overview-diagram.png"
  alt="Authentication and authorization in
Hasura flow diagram"
/>

Hasura uses the role, session variables and the actual GraphQL query itself to validate against the authorization
permission rules defined by you. If the operation is allowed, it generates an optimized SQL query, which includes the
constraints from the permission rules, and sends it to the database to perform the required operation; fetching the
required rows for queries or inserting, editing or deleting rows for mutations.

#### Authentication

Hasura gives you the power to authenticate users how you want, integrating with many popular auth services or your own
existing custom solution hosted elsewhere.

There are 2 ways to authenticate a user:

1. JWT
2. Webhook

In JWT based authentication, a client requests your auth service to get a JWT. Then you can directly pass the JWT to
Hasura, this JWT should have some custom claims (like user role) which will be used to decide what information to show
to the user.

In Webhook based authentication, a client directly calls hasura with some headers. Hasura calls the webhook service with
each request. The webhook service will use your request headers to determine the auth status of the user and return the
user role and any other information as session variables in the response body.

#### Authorization

Hasura also provides role based authorization, using which you can manage access to your data and APIs by defining roles
and permissions. Hasura's fine-grained access control system allows you to specify which users can access which data
ensuring that your application is secure and robust.

Once you authenticate a user, you will get some session variables which will contain user information like user role,
etc. This information can be used to set up role based access control.

Let's go through a simple example. In my group chat app, I have a `users` table. I want to set access control on this
table such that a user can only access their own information.

Let's go through the steps to do it:

1. Go to `users` table, and open `Permissions` tab.
2. You should see the role `admin` has full access to the table by default.
3. Add a new role `user` in the `Enter new role` input.
4. Let's define some permissions on `user` role. Click on `select` column, and it will open a card. Here we are setting
   some permission on selection/querying of the data.
5. In the `Row select permissions`, select `With custom check` and add the permission
   `{"id":{"_eq":"X-Hasura-User-Id"}}`. This will tell Hasura to only send the rows which match the above rule. Here the
   rule states that the `id` column should be equal to the value of session variable `X-Hasura-User-Id`.
6. Open the `Column select permissions` dropdown, and click `Toggle All` button. This defines which columns the given
   role can access.

And we are done. Let's go to the API tab to see this in action.

1. Navigate to `API` tab from top navbar.
2. Query `users` table and don't provide any role based information. We should see all the data as we are providing the
   admin secret so we are making this query in the admin role.
3. Now I'll add the `X-Hasura-Role` and `X-Hasura-User-Id` in the headers. This will tell Hasura about the user and role
   information. Hitting play button again will only give me the selected user's information.

<Player src="/img/getting-started/hasura-use-case/set-permissions.webm" showControls autoPlay={false} loop={false} />

As you probably have guessed, in a production environment these header values will come from session variables (either
using JWT or webhook). So the actual flow will be something like, the front-end client calls a auth service to generate
a JWT with claims containing `X-Hasura-Role` and other info. This JWT will be sent to Hasura by the client. Hasura
decodes the JWT and gets these header values, and the rest of the flow remains the same.

This was just a tip of the iceberg to the many functionalities Hasura provides for doing Auth. You can read more about
it [here](/auth/overview.mdx).

## Advanced topics

There are many more advanced features that hasura provides to handle custom business logic, security, caching,
monitoring and much more. Below we will be going through some of these commonly used features.

### Actions

Actions are a convenient and secure way to connect to REST APIs to achieve any business logic you may need, directly
from your GraphQL API. In the simplest of terms actions send a POST request to your endpoint with a payload.

It is useful in cases like needing to validate user, process or enrich some data, call another API, or log a user in.
With Actions you can connect to a REST endpoint which can be your own custom server, a public API, or a serverless
function. You can also import your existing rest endpoints as actions, from an OpenAPI spec.

[Read more about actions](/actions/overview.mdx)

### Event Triggers

Hasura Event triggers are a way to automate asynchronous logic when changes are made in a connected database.

Event Triggers can be configured to activate when there is an INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE event in a table. Additionally,
you can manually trigger an event through a button set up in the Hasura Console. One example use case of Event triggers
is sending an email to a newly signed up user.

[Read more about Event Triggers](/event-triggers/overview.mdx)

### Caching

Hasura provides a caching layer that can be used to cache the response of a GraphQL query. This can help reduce the
number of requests to your datasources and improve the performance of your application.

You have full control over the cache lifetime and can choose to force the cache to refresh when you need to. With Hasura
Caching, your application is highly-optimized and performant, reducing the load on your servers.

[Read more about caching](/caching/overview.mdx)

### Observability

Hasura Observability is a set of tools that help you monitor and debug your Hasura instance. With Observability, you can
check on the performance of your GraphQL API, debug errors, and get insights into your GraphQL API usage. We provide
detailed error reporting, usage summaries, detailed metrics of graphql operations like query latency, request count, and
error rate.

We offer integrations with popular monitoring tools like Datadog, Prometheus, and OpenTelemetry and you can quickly get
set up with these tools using one of our guides.

[Read more about Observability](/observability/overview.mdx)

### Setting limits on API

Setting some limits on API requests can help prevent API performance issues caused by malicious or poorly implemented
queries, and helps preventing attacks like Denial of Service. You can easily set up various kinds of limits on your API
using the hasura console. There are multiple type of API limits offered by Hasura.

- <b>Rate limits</b> restricts number of GraphQL operations per minute.
- <b>Depth limits</b> restricts a GraphQL operation based on its depth, preventing deeply nested queries.
- <b>Node limits</b> restricts a GraphQL operation based on the number of nodes. This helps in limiting the number of different
  pieces of related data to be fetched.
- <b>Time limits</b> restricts the time that a GraphQL operation is allowed to take.
- <b>Batch Limits</b> restricts the number of GraphQL operations in a batched request.
