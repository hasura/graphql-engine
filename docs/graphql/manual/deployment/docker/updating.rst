This guide will help you update the Hasura GraphQL engine running with Docker. This guide assumes that you already have
Hasura GraphQL engine running with Docker.

Step 1: Check the latest release version
----------------------------------------

The current latest version is:

.. raw:: html

   <code>hasura/graphql-engine:<span class="latest-release-tag">latest</span></code>

All the versions can be found at: https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/releases

Step 2: Update the Docker image
-------------------------------

In the ``docker run`` command or the ``docker-compose`` command that you're running, update the image tag to this
latest version.

For example, if you had:

.. raw:: html

   <code>docker run hasura/graphql-engine:v1.0.0-alpha01 ...</code>

you should change it to:

.. raw:: html

   <code>docker run hasura/graphql-engine:<span class="latest-release-tag">latest</span> ...</code>

.. note::

  If you are downgrading to an older version of the GraphQL engine you might need to downgrade your metadata catalogue version
  as described in :doc:`../downgrading`
