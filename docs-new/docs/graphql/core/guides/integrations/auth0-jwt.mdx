# Auth0 JWT Integration with Hasura GraphQL engine

## Introduction

In this guide, we will walk through how to set up Auth0 to work with the
Hasura GraphQL engine.

## Create an Auth0 Application

-   Navigate to the [Auth0 dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com).
-   Click on the `Applications` menu option on the left and then click
    the `+ Create Application` button.
-   In the `Create Application` window, set a name for your application
    and select `Single Page Web Applications` (assuming your application
    is React/Angular/Vue etc).

## Configure Auth0 Rules & Callback URLs

In the settings of the application, add appropriate (e.g:
[http://localhost:3000/callback](http://localhost:3000/callback)) URLs as `Allowed Callback URLs` and
`Allowed Web Origins`. Add domain specific URLs as well for production
apps (e.g: [https://myapp.com/callback](https://myapp.com/callback)).

Auth0 has multiple versions of its SDK available and unfortunately they
have different semantics when it comes to JWT handling. If you're using
[Auth0.js](https://auth0.com/docs/libraries/auth0js), you'll need to add
a rule to update the <span class="title-ref">idToken</span>. If you're
using the [Auth0 Single Page App SDK](https://auth0.com/docs/libraries/auth0-spa-js), you'll need to add
a rule to update the <span class="title-ref">accessToken</span>. If you
update the wrong token, the necessary Hasura claims will not appear in
the generated JWT and your client will not authenticate properly.

In both cases you'll want to open the Auth0 dashboard and then navigate
to "Rules". Then add a rule to add the custom JWT claims. You can name
the rule anything you want.

For Auth0.js:

```javascript
function (user, context, callback) {
  const namespace = "https://hasura.io/jwt/claims";
  context.idToken[namespace] = 
    { 
      'x-hasura-default-role': 'user',
      // do some custom logic to decide allowed roles
      'x-hasura-allowed-roles': ['user'],
      'x-hasura-user-id': user.user_id
    };
  callback(null, user, context);
}
```

For auth0-spa-js:

```javascript
function (user, context, callback) {
  const namespace = "https://hasura.io/jwt/claims";
  context.accessToken[namespace] =
    {
      'x-hasura-default-role': 'user',
      // do some custom logic to decide allowed roles
      'x-hasura-allowed-roles': ['user'],
      'x-hasura-user-id': user.user_id
    };
  callback(null, user, context);
}
```

## Create an Auth0 API {#test-auth0}

In case you are using auth0-spa-js, you also need to create an API so
that the access token issued by Auth0 is following the JWT standard.
Read more about this
[here](https://auth0.com/docs/tokens/access-tokens#json-web-token-access-tokens).

-   Navigate to the [Auth0 dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com).
-   Click on the `APIs` menu option on the left sidebar and then click
    the `+ Create API` button.
-   In the `New API` window, set a name for your API and enter an
    `identifier` (e.g. `hasura`)
-   In your application code, configure your API `identifier` as the
    `audience` when initializing Auth0, e.g.:

```javascript
<Auth0Provider
  domain={process.env.AUTH_DOMAIN}
  client_id={process.env.AUTH_CLIENT_ID}
  redirect_uri={window.location.origin}
  onRedirectCallback={() => ..}
  audience="hasura"
>
```

## Test auth0 login and generate sample JWTs for testing

You don't need to integrate your UI with auth0 for testing. You can
follow the steps below:

1.  Login to your auth0 app by heading to this URL:
    `https://<auth0-domain>.auth0.com/authorize?client_id=<client_id>&response_type=token%20id_token&redirect_uri=<callback_uri>&scope=openid%20profile&nonce=mynonce`.
    -   Replace `<auth0-domain>` with your auth0 app domain.
    -   Replace `<client-id>` with your auth0 app client id. Get your
        client id from the app settings page on the auth0 dashboard.
    -   Replace `callback_uri` with `https://localhost:3000/callback` or
        the URL you entered above. Note that this URL doesn't really
        need to exist while you are testing.
2.  Once you head to this login page you should see the auth0 login page
    that you can login with.

<img
  src="https://graphql-engine-cdn.hasura.io/img/auth0-login-page.png"
  alt="Auth0 login page"
/>

:::info Note

In case the above method gives a callback error (with `access_denied` in
log), try disabling OIDC Conformant setting
([https://auth0.com/docs/api-auth/tutorials/adoption/oidc-conformant](https://auth0.com/docs/api-auth/tutorials/adoption/oidc-conformant))
under Advanced Settings -> OAuth.

Do note that this method of generating tokens doesn't work in case you
are using `auth0-spa-js` with a custom API created.

:::

3.  After successfully logging in, you will be redirected to
    `https://localhost:3000/callback#xxxxxxxx&id_token=yyyyyyy`. This
    page may be a 404 if you don't have a UI running on localhost:3000.

<img
  src="https://graphql-engine-cdn.hasura.io/img/auth0-localhost-callback-404.png"
  alt="Auth0 successful callback 404 page"
/>

4.  Extract the `id_token` value from this URL. This is the JWT.

<img src="https://graphql-engine-cdn.hasura.io/img/id_token-jwt-url.png" class="no-shadow no-shadow" alt="JWT from id_token query param" />

5.  To test this JWT, and to see if all the Hasura claims are added as
    per the sections above, let's test this out with
    [jwt.io](https://jwt.io)!

<img src="https://graphql-engine-cdn.hasura.io/img/jwt-io-debug.png" class="no-shadow no-shadow" alt="JWT debug on jwt.io" />

**Save this JWT token value so that we can use it later to test
authorization using the Hasura console.**

## Configure Hasura to use Auth0 Keys

Auth0 publishes their JWK under:

`https://<your-auth0-domain>.auth0.com/.well-known/jwks.json`

But they have a [bug where the certificate thumbprint does not match](https://community.auth0.com/t/certificate-thumbprint-is-longer-than-20-bytes/7794/3).
Hence, currently this URL does not work with Hasura.

Current workaround is to download the X590 certificate from:

`https://<your-auth0-domain>.auth0.com/pem`

And use it in the `key` field:

```json
{
  "type":"RS512",
  "key": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----

"
}
```

An easier way to generate the above config is to use the following UI:

[https://hasura.io/jwt-config/](https://hasura.io/jwt-config/).

The generated config can be used in env `HASURA_GRAPHQL_JWT_SECRET` or
`--jwt-secret` flag. The config generated from this page can be directly
pasted in `yaml` files and command line arguments as it takes care of
escaping new lines.

## Add Access Control Rules via Hasura Console

Auth0 is configured and ready to be used in the application. You can now
set up access control rules that will automatically get applied whenever
a client makes a GraphQL request with the Auth0 token.

Refer to [Access control basics](/graphql/core/auth/authorization/basics.mdx) for more information.

To test this out, add an access control rule that uses
`x-hasura-user-id` for the role `user`. Then make a GraphQL query or a
mutation, with the authorization token from the
[previous step](/graphql/core/guides/integrations/auth0-jwt.mdx#test-auth0) where we generated an Auth0 token.

/>

<img src="https://graphql-engine-cdn.hasura.io/img/jwt-header-auth-hasura.png" class="no-shadow no-shadow" alt="JWT token used as bearer token on hasura console" />

You can also use the env variable `HASURA_GRAPHQL_UNAUTHORIZED_ROLE` or
`--unauthorized-role` flag to set a role for **unauthorized users**
(e.g. `anonymous`). This will allow you to set permissions for users
that are not logged in.

The configured unauthorized role will be used whenever an access token
is not present in a request to the GraphQL API.

This can be useful for data that you would like anyone to be able to
access and can be configured and restricted just like any other role.

## Sync Users from Auth0

Now that you have created an Auth0 application and can signup/login, you
will need a way to sync your users in Postgres as well. All you really
need is the Auth0 `user_id` in something like a `users` table.

Using Auth0 Rules again, add the following rule which will insert a new
user every time someone signs up.

```javascript
function (user, context, callback) {
  const userId = user.user_id;
  const url = "https://my-hasura-app.hasura.app/v1/graphql";
  const upsertUserQuery = `
    mutation($userId: String!){
      insert_users(objects: [{ id: $userId }], on_conflict: { constraint: users_pkey, update_columns: [] }) {
        affected_rows
      }
    }`
  const graphqlReq = { "query": upsertUserQuery, "variables": { "userId": userId } }

  request.post({
      headers: {'content-type' : 'application/json', 'x-hasura-admin-secret': configuration.HASURA_ADMIN_SECRET},
      url:   url,
      body:  JSON.stringify(graphqlReq)
  }, function(error, response, body){
       console.log(body);
       callback(null, user, context);
  });
}
```

Make sure to specify the `HASURA_ADMIN_SECRET` variable in the "Rules \>
Settings" section of Auth0.

That’s it! This rule will be triggered on every successful signup/login
and sync your Auth0 user into your postgres database.

:::info Note

We need to use an `upsert` operation here because social logins do not
distinguish between sign-up and login. Hence, we need to run this rule
every time a successful login is made and do nothing if the user already
exists.

:::

:::note Local dev with Auth0 rules

The sync step will require a reachable endpoint to Hasura and this is
not possible in localhost. You can use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) or
similar services to expose your locally running Hasura with a public
endpoint temporarily.
