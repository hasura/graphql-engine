# Using Hasura Cloud with a Heroku Postgres database

<div className='badge badge--primary heading-badge'>Available on: Cloud</div>

## Introduction

In August of 2022, Heroku announced the
[deprecation of their free resources](https://devcenter.heroku.com/changelog-items/2461). Starting November 28th, 2022,
if you have a Hasura project connected to a Heroku database, you'll need to either upgrade your Heroku account or
migrate your database to a new database provider.

## Connecting to Heroku

If you are interested in connecting to a Heroku database, our
[Heroku database integration guide](/projects/heroku-url-sync.mdx) walks you through each step.

## Out-of-the-box database providers

If you're considering migrating your data away from Heroku, Hasura works well with popular database providers. Most of
these providers offer generous free tiers. We have guides you can use to provision and connect a new database in a
matter of minutes. You can check them out [here](/databases/connect-db/cloud-databases/index.mdx).
