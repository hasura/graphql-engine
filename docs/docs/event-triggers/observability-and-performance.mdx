The Hasura Event Triggers system can be segmented into the 2 parts:

### Event capture system

Event capture is accomplished via database triggers. A database trigger is created which is invoked whenever there is an
`INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE` (based on the definition of the event trigger) on the table.

The database trigger captures a per-row change and then writes that to a Hasura Events table. The Hasura Event tables
acts as a queue for all pending/in-process events.

### Event delivery system

Hasura creates a poller thread, which polls the Hasura Event tables for new/pending events. The poller thread fetches
the events in batches (by default 100) and adds them to its in-memory events queue (Hasura Events queue). The polling is
paused if all the HTTP workers (defined below) are busy.

Hasura also creates a pool of HTTP workers (by default 100) which are responsible for delivering the events from the
events queue to the webhook.

After receiving response from the webhook, the event's state is updated in the Hasura Event tables.

## Observability

<ProductBadge self />

Hasura EE exposes a set of [Prometheus metrics](/observability/enterprise-edition/prometheus/metrics.mdx/#hasura-event-triggers-metrics)
that can be used to monitor the Event Trigger system and help diagnose performance issues.

The following metrics can be used to monitor the performance of Hasura Event Triggers system:

- [`hasura_event_fetch_time_per_batch_seconds`](/observability/enterprise-edition/prometheus/metrics.mdx/#event-fetch-time-per-batch)
- [`hasura_event_invocations_total`](/observability/enterprise-edition/prometheus/metrics.mdx/#event-invocations-total)
- [`hasura_event_processed_total`](/observability/enterprise-edition/prometheus/metrics.mdx/#event-processed-total)
- [`hasura_event_processing_time_seconds`](/observability/enterprise-edition/prometheus/metrics.mdx/#event-processing-time)
- [`hasura_event_queue_time_seconds`](/observability/enterprise-edition/prometheus/metrics.mdx/#event-queue-time)
- [`hasura_event_trigger_http_workers`](/observability/enterprise-edition/prometheus/metrics.mdx/#event-triggers-http-workers)
- [`hasura_event_webhook_processing_time_seconds`](/observability/enterprise-edition/prometheus/metrics.mdx/#event-webhook-processing-time)
- [`hasura_events_fetched_per_batch`](/observability/enterprise-edition/prometheus/metrics.mdx/#events-fetched-per-batch)

## Golden signals for Hasura Event Triggers

You can perform
[Golden Signals-based](https://sre.google/sre-book/monitoring-distributed-systems/#xref_monitoring_golden-signals)
system monitoring with Hasura's exported metrics. The following are the golden signals for analyzing Hasura Event
Triggers system performance.

### Latency

Latency for the Event Triggers system is the time taken by Hasura GraphQL Engine to deliver events. To monitor this
latency, you can use the [`hasura_event_processing_time_seconds`](#event-processing-time) metric.

If the value of this metric is high, it may be an indication that events are taking a longer time to be processed and
delivered.

The following are few things you can do to analyze and diagnose the latency issue:

1.  **Investigate DB performance**: Check the value of the
    [`hasura_event_fetch_time_per_batch_seconds`](#event-fetch-time-per-batch) metric. If the value of this metric is
    high, it maybe an indication that the database is slow. Consider optimizing the database.
2.  **Investigate HTTP Worker Saturation**: Check the value of the
    [`hasura_event_queue_time_seconds`](#event-queue-time) metric. If the value of this metric is high, it maybe an
    indication that all the HTTP workers are saturated and are not able to pick up the events from the `Events Queue`.
    Consider increasing the
    [Events HTTP Pool Size](/deployment/graphql-engine-flags/reference.mdx/#events-http-pool-size)
3.  **Investigate Webhook Performance**: Check the value of the
    [`hasura_event_webhook_processing_time_seconds`](#event-webhook-processing-time) metric. If the value of this metric
    is high, it maybe an indication that the webhook is slow. Consider optimizing the webhook.

You can also try [scaling](/latest/faq/index/#faq-scaling) your Hasura instance horizontally to handle more events.

### Saturation

Saturation is the threshold until which the Hasura Event Triggers system can run smoothly. Once this threshold is
crossed, you may see performance issues such as high event processing time, etc.

Saturation for the Event Trigger system references the difference between the incoming events rate and event delivery
rate.

```
Saturation =  No. of active HTTP workers / No. of total HTTP workers
```

To monitor saturation, you can use the following:

1.  **Investigate HTTP Workers**: Compare the active HTTP workers
    [`hasura_event_trigger_http_workers`](#event-triggers-http-workers) with the
    [Events HTTP Pool Size](/deployment/graphql-engine-flags/reference.mdx/#events-http-pool-size). Saturation is high
    if the active HTTP workers is near the HTTP pool size. If HTTP workers are saturated then it maybe also indicate
    that the `hasura_event_queue_time_seconds` is also high. Consider Increasing the number of HTTP workers by
    increasing the [Events HTTP Pool Size](/deployment/graphql-engine-flags/reference.mdx/#events-http-pool-size)

### Traffic

Traffic for Event Triggers is the number of new events created in a given time frame (like 1000 events per minute).
Events can be created even if mutations don't go through Hasura i.e. using some other client. Hence, Hasura doesn't
give the number of events as metrics, but you can find this out by using metadata APIs like
[pg_get_event_logs](/latest/api-reference/metadata-api/event-triggers/#metadata-pg-get-event-logs). "Proxy"
metrics for traffic are the number of mutations, number of events processed and number of events fetched per batch.

To monitor traffic, you can use the [`hasura_event_processed_total`](#event-processed-total) and the
[`hasura_events_fetched_per_batch`](#events-fetched-per-batch) metrics.

If the value of `hasura_events_fetched_per_batch` is close to the configured max batch size, then it hints that there
may be some pending events in the database yet to be fetched and processed.

### Errors

Errors for an Event Trigger references the number of event deliveries that failed or errored out.

To monitor errors, you can use the [`hasura_event_processed_total`](#event-processed-total) metric. You can then filter
the metric using the label `status: failed` i.e., `hasura_event_processed_total{status="failure"}`.

You can do to the following to analyze and diagnose errors:

1.  Identify the Event Trigger with a high error rate. You can do this by using the above metric and see the trigger
    name associated to that metric in the `trigger_name` label.
2.  You can then use the
    [`*_get_event_logs`](/api-reference/metadata-api/event-triggers.mdx/#metadata-pg-get-event-logs) and
    [`*_get_event_invocation_logs`](/api-reference/metadata-api/event-triggers.mdx/#metadata-pg-get-event-invocation-logs)
    metadata API to get the error logs for the Event Trigger. This should provide some insights into the error.

## Tuning Hasura Event Triggers performance

Hasura Event Triggers are designed to handle of millions of events per hour. However, due to misconfigurations or other
reasons, the performance of the Hasura Event Triggers system can be impacted. This section describes how to tune the
performance of subscriptions.

### Performance tuning

Event Trigger processing can be tuned by few server settings as described below:

- [`HASURA_GRAPHQL_EVENTS_FETCH_BATCH_SIZE`](/deployment/graphql-engine-flags/reference.mdx/#events-fetch-batch-size):
  - The number of events fetched from the `Hasura Event tables` in the database per batch. By default, 100.
  - Increasing this will fetch more events from the database per batch, thereby reducing the load on database and
    improving throughput while increasing individual fetch SQL execution times and, potentially, the memory of the
    Hasura instance.
- [`HASURA_GRAPHQL_EVENTS_HTTP_POOL_SIZE`](/deployment/graphql-engine-flags/reference.mdx/#events-http-pool-size):
  - The maximum number of HTTP workers that are spawned to deliver events to the webhook. By default, 100.
  - Increasing this will spawn more HTTP workers, thereby increasing the number of concurrent event deliveries to the
    webhook. This may also increase the memory and the CPU usage of the Hasura instance.
- [`HASURA_GRAPHQL_EVENTS_FETCH_INTERVAL`](/deployment/graphql-engine-flags/reference.mdx/#events-fetch-interval):
  - The interval at which Hasura polls the database for new events. By default, 1 second.
  - Increasing this reduces frequency of the poll to the database reducing the load on it while increasing the latency
    of processing of event.
