# Hasura CLI: hasura metadata diff

(PREVIEW) Show a highlighted diff of Hasura metadata.

## Synopsis

(PREVIEW) Show changes between two different sets of Hasura metadata. By
default, it shows changes between the exported metadata file and server
metadata.

```
hasura metadata diff [file1] [file2] [flags]
```

## Examples

```
# NOTE: This command is in preview, usage and diff format may change.

# Show changes between server metadata and the exported metadata file:
hasura metadata diff

# Show changes between server metadata and that in local_metadata.yaml:
hasura metadata diff local_metadata.yaml

# Show changes between metadata from metadata.yaml and metadata_old.yaml:
hasura metadata diff metadata.yaml metadata_old.yaml

# Apply admin secret for Hasura GraphQL engine:
hasura metadata diff --admin-secret "<admin-secret>"

# For unified diff as the default diff just outputs only the difference:
hasura metadata diff --type "unified-common"

# Diff metadata on a different Hasura instance:
hasura metadata diff --endpoint "<endpoint>"
