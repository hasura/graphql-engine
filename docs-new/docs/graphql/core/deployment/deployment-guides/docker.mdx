# Run Hasura GraphQL engine using Docker

## Introduction

This guide will help you deploy the Hasura GraphQL engine and a Postgres
database to store its metadata using Docker Compose.

## Deploying Hasura using Docker

### Prerequisites

-   [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
-   [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Step 1: Get the docker-compose file

The
[hasura/graphql-engine/install-manifests](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/tree/stable/install-manifests)
repo contains all installation manifests required to deploy Hasura
anywhere. Get the docker compose file from there:

```bash
# in a new directory run
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hasura/graphql-engine/stable/install-manifests/docker-compose/docker-compose.yaml
# or run
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hasura/graphql-engine/stable/install-manifests/docker-compose/docker-compose.yaml -o docker-compose.yml
```

## Step 2: Run Hasura GraphQL engine

The following command will run Hasura GraphQL engine along with a
Postgres database to store its metadata.

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
```

Check if the containers are running:

```bash
$ docker ps

CONTAINER ID IMAGE                 ... CREATED STATUS PORTS          ...
097f58433a2b hasura/graphql-engine ... 1m ago  Up 1m  8080->8080/tcp ...
b0b1aac0508d postgres              ... 1m ago  Up 1m  5432/tcp       ...
```

## Securing the GraphQL endpoint {#docker-secure}

To make sure that your GraphQL endpoint and the Hasura console are not
publicly accessible, you need to configure an admin secret key.

### Run the Docker container with an admin-secret env var

```yaml {5}
graphql-engine:
  image: hasura/graphql-engine:v2.0.0
  environment:
    HASURA_GRAPHQL_METADATA_DATABASE_URL: postgres://postgres:postgrespassword@postgres:5432/postgres
    HASURA_GRAPHQL_ADMIN_SECRET: myadminsecretkey
  ...
```

:::info Note

The `HASURA_GRAPHQL_ADMIN_SECRET` should never be passed from the client
to the Hasura GraphQL engine as it would give the client full admin
rights to your Hasura instance. See [Authentication & Authorization](/graphql/core/auth/index.mdx) for information on setting up
authentication.

:::

<!--
.. hiding this as it mixes auth for the data plane with auth for the control plane and might be confusing

  .. admonition:: Using collaborators as an alternative to Hasura Admin Secret sharing with Hasura Cloud
    :class: dhc

    Hasura Cloud offers console collaborators which avoids sharing the `HASURA-ADMIN-SECRET` with those that shouldn't have unrestricted access to your project. For more information about collaborator management, see :ref:`Collaborators in Hasura Cloud <manage_project_collaborators>`.
-->

## Hasura GraphQL engine server logs {#docker-logs}

You can check the logs of the Hasura GraphQL engine deployed using
Docker by checking the logs of the GraphQL engine container:

```bash
$ docker ps

CONTAINER ID IMAGE                 ... CREATED STATUS PORTS          ...
097f58433a2b hasura/graphql-engine ... 1m ago  Up 1m  8080->8080/tcp ...
b0b1aac0508d postgres              ... 1m ago  Up 1m  5432/tcp       ...


$ docker logs 097f58433a2b

{"timestamp":"2018-10-09T11:20:32.054+0000", "level":"info", "type":"http-log", "detail":{"status":200, "query_hash":"01640c6dd131826cff44308111ed40d7fbd1cbed", "http_version":"HTTP/1.1", "query_execution_time":3.0177627e-2, "request_id":null, "url":"/v1/graphql", "user":{"x-hasura-role":"admin"}, "ip":"127.0.0.1", "response_size":209329, "method":"POST", "detail":null}}
...
```

**See:**

-   [https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging) for more details
    on logging in Docker.
-   [Hasura GraphQL engine logs](/graphql/core/deployment/logging.mdx) for more details on Hasura logs.

## Updating Hasura GraphQL engine {#docker-update}

This guide will help you update the Hasura GraphQL engine running with
Docker. This guide assumes that you already have Hasura GraphQL engine
running with Docker.

### Step 1: Check the latest release version

The current latest version is:

<code>hasura/graphql-engine:<LatestRelease /></code>

All the versions can be found at:
[https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/releases](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/releases)

### Step 2: Update the Docker image

In the `docker-compose` command that you're running, update the image
tag to this latest version.

For example, if you had:

```yaml
graphql-engine:
  image: hasura/graphql-engine:v1.2.0
```

you should change it to:

<pre>
<code>
graphql-engine:<br/>
{"  "}image: hasura/graphql-engine:<LatestRelease />
</code>
</pre>


:::info Note

If you are downgrading to an older version of the GraphQL engine you
might need to downgrade your metadata catalogue version as described in
[Downgrading Hasura GraphQL engine](/graphql/core/deployment/downgrading.mdx)
