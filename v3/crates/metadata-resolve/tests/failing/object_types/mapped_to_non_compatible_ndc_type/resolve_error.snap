The following issues were raised but disallowed by compatibility configuration:

The field 'id' in object type 'institution (in subgraph default)' cannot be mapped to data connector 'custom (in subgraph default)' field 'institution.id' because: Type 'Float!' is not compatible with NDC type 'Named { name: TypeName("Int") }' - Inbuilt type 'Float' is not compatible with the data connector's type representation 'Int32'
