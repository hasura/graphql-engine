# Project ownership transfer

## Introduction

You can transfer ownership of your project to another user. After the
ownership is transferred successfully, the original owner will lose all
access to the project.

:::info Note

If the project is on the `Standard` (pay-as-you-go) tier, the new owner
will pay for the entire data usage for the month in which the ownership
is transferred.

:::

## Send an ownership transfer invitation

Go to the project settings page and scroll to the bottom. Enter the
email of the user you want to transfer the project ownership to.
