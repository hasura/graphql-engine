# Deploying Hasura GraphQL engine on Render

## Introduction

This guide shows how to deploy the Hasura GraphQL engine on [Render](https://render.com).

## One-click Deploy on Render

:::info Note

Make sure to [create a free Render account](https://render.com/register)
first.

:::

Once you're logged into your Render account, click the button below to
deploy Hasura and a new managed PostgreSQL database wired up to your
Hasura instance.

You will see the Hasura web service and PostgreSQL instance to be
created:

That's it! Read on to configure your Hasura instance.

## Access your Hasura Console

Once **Deploy to Render** succeeds, you can click through to your Hasura
service page on Render's dashboard.

You can monitor the deployment of the Hasura web service from the
**Logs** tab. Once the service is up, use the link on the service page
to access your Hasura console:

```bash
https://<your-hasura-slug>.onrender.com/
```

You can create tables and test your GraphQL queries here.
