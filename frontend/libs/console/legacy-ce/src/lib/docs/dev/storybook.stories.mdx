# Storybook

Here are the current limitation when porting component to storybook :

- There is no bootstrap setup inside of storybook, this is because of 2 main reasons :
  - The current boostrap version (3) has some incompatibility and is imported in the codebase through webpack as an entry point
  - We want to move all the component to tailwindcss

This is still an in progress effort.
