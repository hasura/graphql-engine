# MongoDB

:::tip MongoDB Beta Availability

The Hasura MongoDB connector is currently in `beta` for Hasura Enterprise Edition customers and is available
from Hasura GraphQL Engine `v2.27.0` onwards.

Hasura Cloud support for MongoDB will be coming soon. Once the MongoDB connector is generally available (GA), it will be
available **only** for Hasura Cloud Enterprise and Enterprise Edition customers.

:::

## Introduction

Hasura supports connecting to a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) service to automatically build a GraphQL API based
on its validation schema.

## Get Started

To try Hasura with MongoDB, you'll need a new or existing MongoDB instance (either self-hosted, or available through
MongoDB Atlas).

You can currently get started with Hasura and MongoDB using [Docker](/databases/mongodb/docker.mdx).

## Keep up to date

:::info Note

Currently, Hasura supports read-only queries on MongoDB.<br/> Other limitations which are actively on the roadmap and
will be supported soon include:

- Embedded document queries and permissions.
- Cross-Collection relationships (executed within the database).
- Logical models to support schema customization and bespoke query execution.
