-- = Background
--
-- We use Haskell's @Arrows@ language extension to gain some syntactic sugar when
-- working with `Arrow`s. `Arrow`s are a programming abstraction comparable to
-- `Monad`s.
--
-- Unfortunately the syntactic sugar provided by this language extension is not
-- very sweet.
--
-- This module allows us to sometimes avoid using @Arrows@ syntax altogether,
-- without loss of functionality or correctness. It is a demo of a technique that
-- can be used to cut down the amount of @Arrows@-based code in our codebase by
-- about half.
--
-- = Approach
--
-- Although /in general/ not every `Monad` is an `Arrow`, specific `Arrow`
-- instantiations are exactly as powerful as their `Monad` equivalents. Otherwise
-- they wouldn't be very equivalent, would they?
--
-- Just like `liftEither` interprets the @`Either` e@ monad into an arbitrary
-- monad implementing @`MonadError` e@, we add interpret certain concrete monads
-- such as @`Control.Monad.Trans.Writer.CPS.Writer` w@ into arrows satisfying
-- constraints, in this example the ones satisfying @`ArrowWriter` w@.  This
-- means that the part of the code that only uses such interpretable arrow
-- effects can be written /monadically/, and then used in /arrow/ constructions
-- down the line.
--
-- This approach cannot be used for arrow effects which do not have a monadic
-- equivalent. In our codebase, the only instance of this is
-- @`Hasura.Incremental.ArrowCache` m@, implemented by the
-- @`Hasura.Incremental.Rule` m@ arrow. So code written with
-- @`Hasura.Incremental.ArrowCache` m@ in the context cannot be rewritten
-- monadically using this technique.

-- | Translate a monadic writer effect stack of a computation into arrow-based
-- effects.

-- NB: This is conceptually different from `ArrowKleisli`, which /inserts/ a
-- single monadic effect into an arrow-based effect stack.
--
-- NB: This is conceptually different from `ArrowApply`, which expresses that a
-- given `Arrow` /is/ a Kleisli arrow.  `ArrowInterpret` has no such condition
-- on @arr@.
