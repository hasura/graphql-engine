# Scheduled Triggers

## Introduction

Hasura Scheduled Triggers is a powerful feature that allows you to schedule tasks or events in your application based on
specific time intervals. It is a trigger-based system that executes tasks at predefined intervals, specified in a
cron-like syntax.

## How Hasura Scheduled Triggers Work

Hasura Scheduled Triggers work by executing a webhook at a specified time interval. A webhook is an HTTP callback that
is triggered by an event. When the webhook is triggered, it sends a request to the specified endpoint, which then
executes the task or event defined.

## Use Cases of Hasura Scheduled Triggers

Hasura Scheduled Triggers can be used for a variety of use cases, including:

- Sending reminders to users about upcoming events or appointments
- Generating reports or analytics on a scheduled basis
- Updating or cleaning up data on a regular basis, such as archiving old data or deleting expired records
- Running maintenance tasks, such as backups or security checks
- Scheduling automated emails or notifications to users
