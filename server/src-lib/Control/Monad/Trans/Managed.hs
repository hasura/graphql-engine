-- | This type is like a transformer version of the @Managed@ monad from the
-- @managed@ library. It can be used to manage resources by pairing together
-- their allocation with their finalizers.
--
-- The documentation for the @managed@ library is an excellent introduction to
-- the idea here.
--
-- We could use 'Codensity' directly, but we'd have to define an orphan instance
-- for 'MonadFix'. This also gives us the opportunity to give it a slightly more
-- friendly name.
--
-- We could also have used @ResourceT@, but that would have involved writing
-- instances for @MonadUnliftIO@. That could still be a good option to consider
-- later, however.
