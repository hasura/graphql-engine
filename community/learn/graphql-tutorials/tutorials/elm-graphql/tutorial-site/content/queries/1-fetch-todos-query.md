The first graphql query you will write will be to fetch personal todos. You will need to load the todo data from the database which belongs to the logged in user. Let's define a graphql query to fetch the required data.

```graphql
query getMyTodos {
  todos(where: { is_public: { _eq: false} }, order_by: { created_at: desc }) {
    id
    title
    created_at
    is_completed
  }
}
```

[Try](https://learn.hasura.io/graphql/graphiql?tutorial=react-native) this query in GraphiQL against the application database to see what the response looks like.

**Note**: You need to pass the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header before querying to get the results. The token is auto-filled in the UI after logging in via Auth0.

We will be generating the above query using the utility functions generated by `elm-graphql` in our elm app. Lets verify it for now to make sure it works as expected.

Let's dive into the elm code to fetch personal todos in our elm app.
