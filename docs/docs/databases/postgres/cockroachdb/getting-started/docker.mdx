# Get Started with Hasura (Docker) & CockroachDB

## Try it out

### Pre-requisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- Optionally, an existing [CockroachDB database](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/get-started-cockroachdb/)

### Step 1: Get the docker-compose file

Get the Hasura docker-compose file:

```bash
# in a new directory run
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hasura/graphql-engine/master/install-manifests/docker-compose-cockroach/docker-compose.yaml
# or run
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hasura/graphql-engine/master/install-manifests/docker-compose-cockroach/docker-compose.yaml -o docker-compose.yaml
```

### Step 2: Run Hasura GraphQL Engine and a CockroachDB instance

The following command will run Hasura along with a Postgres database required for its functioning.

```bash
$ docker compose up -d
```

Check that the containers are running:

```
$ docker ps

CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                 ... CREATED        STATUS          PORTS            ...
a6956d1492fd   hasura/graphql-engine ... 1 minute ago   Up 10 seconds   8080->8080/tcp   ...
f0931e41c608   cockroach             ... 1 minute ago   Up 10 seconds   26257->26257/tcp ...
42cd380d6ceb   postgres              ... 1 minute ago   Up 10 seconds   5432/tcp         ...

Please do note that you will see a Postgres database running, which is used by Hasura to store its configuration (Hasura Metadata).
```

### Step 3: Open the Hasura Console

Head to `http://localhost:8080/console` to open the Hasura Console.

### Step 4: Add your CockroachDB database as a source to Hasura

In the `Data > Data Manager > Connect Existing Database` section on the Console, select `CockroachDB` from the
`Data Source Driver` dropdown and add the connection string directly or through an environment variable. As CockroachDB
speaks the same protocol as Postgres, the connection string will start with `postgres://`, i.e, there is no difference
between CockroachDB's connection strings and Postgres’s connection strings.

If you're testing Hasura with CockroachDB running locally,
[read this guide](/deployment/deployment-guides/docker.mdx#docker-networking) on Docker networking if you're not sure
how to reach your CockroachDB database from the Hasura docker container on Linux, Mac or Windows.

<Thumbnail

  alt='Add source added with docker-compose'
  width='1100px'
/>

This example uses the DB url `postgresql://root@cockroach:26257/hasura`, with the service name `cockroach`, as both
Hasura and the CockroachDB services are configured in the above-mentioned `docker-compose.yaml` file.

Once you add the database, you'll see your database pop up on the sidebar.

### Optional: Populate the CockroachDB database

The following examples use `author` and `articles` tables, which can be set up as follows.

1. Connect to the CockroachDB container and start the `sql` command line tool:

```bash
docker exec -it docker-compose-cockroach-cockroach-1 ./cockroach sql --insecure
```

2. Once the command line tool has started, execute the following to set up example tables:

```sql
CREATE TABLE author(
    id serial PRIMARY KEY,
    name text UNIQUE,
    "createdAt" timestamp
);

CREATE TABLE article (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title TEXT,
    content TEXT,
    author_id INTEGER REFERENCES author(id),
    is_published BOOLEAN
);

-- Inserting sequential ids for demo purposes
-- See https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/v22.2/serial.html
INSERT INTO
    author (id, name, "createdAt")
VALUES
    (1, 'Author 3', '2017-09-21T09:39:44'),
    (2, 'Author 4', '2017-09-21T09:50:44');

INSERT INTO
    article (title, content, author_id, is_published)
VALUES
    (
        'Article 1',
        'Sample article content 1',
        1,
        false
    ),
    (
        'Article 2',
        'Sample article content 2',
        1,
        TRUE
    ),
    (
        'Article 3',
        'Sample article content 3',
        2,
        TRUE
    );

```

### Step 5: Track existing tables or create new tables

If you have existing tables, head to the database page by clicking on the database name on the sidebar. You should see a
list of tables.

<!--

   .. thumbnail:: /img/databases/ms-sql-server/3-manage-mydb.png
      :alt: Manage my-db
      :width: 1000px

-->

Track tables selectively or all of them so that Hasura can introspect the tables and create the corresponding GraphQL
schema.

If you have foreign keys, you'll also see suggested relationships. Again, you can choose to track them selectively or
all at once.

  alt='Track foreign-key relationships'
  width='1100px'
/>

If you don't have existing tables, go ahead and add new tables and data and try out some queries, just like with a
regular Postgres database.

### Step 6: Try out a GraphQL query

Head to the `API` tab in the Console and try running a GraphQL query! Use the explorer sidebar on GraphQL to get help in
creating a GraphQL query.

## Keep up to date

Hasura currently supports [queries](/queries/postgres/index.mdx),
[relationships](/schema/postgres/table-relationships/index.mdx), and [mutations](/mutations/postgres/index.mdx) on
CockroachDB.

Please refer to the [Postgres docs](/queries/postgres/index.mdx) on how you can try these features out via the Console
or by manipulating metadata in JSON/YAML directly.
