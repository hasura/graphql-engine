# Security Vulnerability Protocol

<!-- inspired and adapted from https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/issues-security/security/ (https://github.com/kubernetes/website/blob/master/content/en/docs/reference/issues-security/security.md) -->

## Introduction

This page describes the Hasura security vulnerability reporting and disclosure process.

## Security announcements

Join the [Hasura Security Announcements](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/hasura-security-announce) group for
emails about security announcements.

## Reporting vulnerabilities

We’re extremely grateful for security researchers and users who report vulnerabilities to the Hasura community. All
reports are thoroughly investigated by the Hasura team.

To report a security issue, please email us at <security@hasura.io> with details, if possible attaching relevant
information. The more details we have, the quicker will we be able to fix potential vulnerabilities.

We do not currently have a bug bounty program, however, for valid high and critical severity issues we may, at our
discretion, choose to award a bounty. Please see our guidance at the bottom of the page for types of vulnerabilities
which are in and out of scope. Do not use social engineering and make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations,
destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our service. If you should accidentally do any of these things,
stop immediately and report the issue.

### When should I report a vulnerability?

- You think you have discovered a potential security vulnerability in the Hasura GraphQL Engine or related components.
- You are unsure how a vulnerability affects the Hasura GraphQL Engine.
- You think you discovered a vulnerability in another project that Hasura GraphQL Engine depends on (e.g. Heroku,
  Docker, etc).
- You want to report any other security risk that could potentially harm Hasura GraphQL Engine users.

### When should I NOT report a vulnerability?

- You need help tuning Hasura GraphQL Engine components for security.
- You need help applying security related updates.
- Your issue is not security related.

In these cases you can join our [Discord server](https://hasura.io/discord) where the community will be happy to help
you out.

## Vulnerability report response

Each vulnerability report is acknowledged and analyzed by the Hasura team within 3 working days.

The reporter will be kept updated at every stage of the issue’s analysis and resolution (triage -> fix -> release).

## Vulnerability public disclosure timing

A public disclosure date in case a vulnerability is discovered is negotiated by the Hasura team and the bug submitter.

We prefer to fully disclose the vulnerability as soon as possible once a user mitigation is available and enough of the
affected instances have been upgraded.

It is reasonable to delay disclosure when the vulnerability or the fix is not yet fully understood, the solution is not
well-tested, or for vendor coordination. The time frame for disclosure is from immediate (especially if the
vulnerability is already publicly known) to a few weeks. Though, we expect the time frame between a report to a public
disclosure to typically be in the order of 7 days.

In any case, the Hasura team will do their best to identify and fix any vulnerabilities as soon as possible, as well as
communicate to the submitter about the progress and set a disclosure date.

## Vulnerability categories we encourage be reported

We are keen on hearing about the vulnerabilities encompassing the following categories:

- SQL Injection scenarios.
- Server side injection cases.
- Access control related issues.
- Authentication/Authorization related issues.
- Remote Code Execution.
- Cross Site Scripting (XSS).
- Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks when an operation can be performed on behalf of the user.
- Data Exposure.
- Any unique issues that do not fall into explicit categories.

## Out of scope vulnerabilities

When reporting vulnerabilities, please consider (1) attack scenario / exploitability, and (2) security impact of the
bug. The following issues are considered out of scope:

- Clickjacking on pages with no sensitive actions.
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) on unauthenticated forms or forms with no sensitive actions.
- Attacks requiring MITM or physical access to a user's device.
- Previously known vulnerable libraries without a working proof of concept.
- Comma Separated Values (CSV) injection without demonstrating a vulnerability.
- Missing best practices in SSL/TLS configuration.
- Any activity that could lead to the disruption of our service (DoS).
- Content spoofing and text injection issues without showing an attack vector/without being able to modify HTML/CSS.
- Rate limiting or bruteforce issues on non-authentication endpoints.
- Missing best practices in Content Security Policy.
- Missing HttpOnly or Secure flags on cookies.
- Missing email best practices (invalid, incomplete or missing SPF/DKIM/DMARC records, etc.).
- Vulnerabilities only affecting users of outdated or unpatched browsers [Less than 2 stable versions behind the latest
  released stable version].
- Software version disclosure / Banner identification issues / Descriptive error messages or headers (e.g. stack traces,
  application or server errors).
- Public Zero-day vulnerabilities that have had an official patch for less than 1 month will be awarded on a
  case-by-case basis.
- Tabnabbing.
- Open redirect - unless an additional security impact can be demonstrated.
- Issues that require unlikely user interaction.
- Missing best practices in Content Security Policy (CSP) or lack of other security-related headers.
- Leakage of sensitive tokens (e.g., reset password token) to trusted third parties on secure connection (HTTPS).
- Bugs in third-party components which the Hasura uses only qualify if you can prove that they can be used to
  successfully attack Hasura's in scope applications.
- SSRF issues - To be eligible for a bounty on HTTP/WS based SSRF submissions, please provide a proof of concept
  demonstrating access to sensitive resources such as leaking sensitive API keys or the ability to trigger state
  changing actions. Exploits just demonstrating a service header being responded would not meet the threshold.
