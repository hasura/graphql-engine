# Uninstalling the Hasura CLI

## Uninstall a binary

If you installed the binary directly on your system (probably through
shell script), delete the binary file from its installation location.

```bash
# By default, the binary is installed at /usr/local/bin/hasura
$ which hasura
  /usr/local/bin/hasura

# use sudo if required
$ rm /usr/local/bin/hasura
```

## Uninstall an npm package

If you installed the CLI as an npm package, use npm (or yarn).

```bash
# if installed as a project dependency
npm uninstall hasura-cli

# if installed as a global package
npm uninstall --global hasura-cli
```
