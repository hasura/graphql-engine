# Production checklist

## Introduction

This guide is a checklist for configuring and securing GraphQL engine
for a production deployment.

:::info Hasura Cloud the fastest way to production

Many of the following steps are pre-configured in a Hasura Cloud
instance with integrated logging, API limits, caching and more. For more
information about our hosted Hasura product, see
[Hasura Cloud docs](/graphql/cloud/index.mdx).

:::

## Set an admin secret

Set an admin secret to protect the API from unauthorized access. It is
recommended to keep this as a long string.

```bash
# set env var
HASURA_GRAPHQL_ADMIN_SECRET=averylongpasswordstring

# or use the flag
graphql-engine --database-url=<database-url> serve --admin-secret=averylongpasswordstring
```

More details can be found at [Securing the GraphQL endpoint](/graphql/core/deployment/securing-graphql-endpoint.mdx).

## Verify permissions

<TOCInline toc={toc} filterTOC={(tocTree) => tocTree[2].children} />

### Review the summary

Review the authorization/permission rules set on tables. You can make
use of the "Schema permissions summary" page to get a bird's eye view on
all the permissions set across all tables and roles. Pay extra attention
to roles like "anonymous" which allow unauthenticated access.

### Limit number of rows returned

You should [limit the number of rows](/graphql/core/auth/authorization/permission-rules.mdx#limit-rows-permissions) that can
be accessed in one request, by setting the number in the select
permission. This will prevent someone from accidentally or otherwise
querying the entire table in one shot, thus adding load on Postgres.

## Disable APIs

Hasura exposes many APIs which might not be relevant for a production
instance that is only supposed to serve GraphQL. APIs can be selectively
enabled using the corresponding flag or environment variable.

In most production scenarios, you would only need GraphQL API to be
enabled.

```bash
# set this env var to enable only the graphql api
HASURA_GRAPHQL_ENABLED_APIS=graphql

# if you're using flags
graphql-engine --database-url=<database-url> serve --enabled-apis=graphql
```

By setting the above flag or env var, we are disabling the `metadata`,
`pgdump` and `config` APIs. `health` and `version` APIs are public and
cannot be disabled.

Read more about all the API types at the
[API reference](/graphql/core/api-reference/index.mdx).

:::info Note

If you're using `cli-migrations` image, prior to `v1.0.0-beta.8`,
setting enabled APIs to only `graphql` can cause the migration apply
step to fail. Please update to the latest version if you're facing this
issue.

:::

## Disable console

It is recommended that you disable the console on production deployments to prevent accidental changes to your production environment.
Also, when you disable the metadata API, console will stop working.

The console is disabled by default.

```bash
# set the env var to false or do not set it at all to disable console
HASURA_GRAPHQL_ENABLE_CONSOLE=false

# when using flags, no --enable-console flag implies console is disabled
graphql-engine --database-url=<database-url> serve
```

:::info Note

You can still use the CLI to open a console connected to this instance.
(Provided `metadata` APIs are not disabled).

:::

## Disable dev mode

It is recommended that you disable the [dev mode](/graphql/core/deployment/graphql-engine-flags/config-examples.mdx#dev-mode) on
production deployments for non-admin roles to avoid leaking internal
debugging information to the clients in case of API errors.

The dev mode is disabled by default.

```bash
# set the env var to false or do not set it at all to disable dev mode
HASURA_GRAPHQL_DEV_MODE=false

# when using flags, no --dev-mode flag implies dev mode is disabled
graphql-engine --database-url=<database-url> serve
```

## Set up an allow-list

An allow-list can be set up to restrict what kind of requests can be
made against this particular instance. If your API is meant to serve a
frontend client, you can only allow those requests used by the client to
pass through. Every other request will be rejected without even getting
validated.

Read more at [Allow-list of operations](/graphql/core/deployment/allow-list.mdx).

## Restrict CORS domains

By default, all cross-origin requests are allowed by Hasura GraphQL
engine. You should restrict them to the domains which you trust.

```bash
# set the env var, accept cross-origin requests from https://my-ui.com
HASURA_GRAPHQL_CORS_DOMAIN=https://my-ui.com

# using flags
graphql-engine --database-url=<database-url> server --cors-domain="https://my-ui.com"
```

You can read more about this setting at [Configure CORS](/graphql/core/deployment/graphql-engine-flags/config-examples.mdx#configure-cors).

## Enable HTTPS

Production APIs should be served over HTTPS to be secure over the
network.

See [Enable HTTPS](/graphql/core/deployment/enable-https.mdx) for details on achieving this.

## Configure logging

The [logs guide](/graphql/core/deployment/logging.mdx) describes different log types and log levels
Hasura GraphQL engine uses. You can configure the GraphQL engine to
enable/disable certain log-types using the the `--enabled-log-types`
flag or the `HASURA_GRAPHQL_ENABLED_LOG_TYPES` env var.

If you are collecting your logs using an agent and you're interested in
capturing the request logs along with the SQL that is generated, you
should enable `query-log` *(it is not enabled by default)*.

```bash
# enable all log types
HASURA_GRAPHQL_ENABLED_LOG_TYPES=startup,http-log,query-log,websocket-log,webhook-log

# using flags
graphql-engine --database-url=<database-url>
serve --enabled-log-types="startup,http-log,query-log,websocket-log,webhook-log"
```
