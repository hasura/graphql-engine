Add the default Hasura domain as a `CNAME` record to your DNS.

:::info Note

If you're using [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com) as your DNS provider, do not enable the proxy (orange cloud)
until the certificate is generated. i.e. `Proxy status` should be `DNS only`. You can enable the proxy after SSL
certificate is generated.

:::

Until this is done, the dashboard will show a notice that the DNS validation is pending.

:::info Note

Depending on your DNS provider, it might take up to 24 hours for the DNS record to be added.

## DNS validated

Once the DNS is validated, the dashboard will update the status with the following notice:
