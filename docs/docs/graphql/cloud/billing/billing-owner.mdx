# Billing Owner

## Introduction

You can invite a billing owner to take responsibility of the project's
invoicing. The `Collaborators` tab displays the current user who is in
charge of project billing as well as the user who has been invited to
take on the billing owner responsibility.

## Invite a billing owner

### Invite a new collaborator as billing owner

Click `Invite a Collaborator` to invite a new collaborator as a billing
owner by their email.

privilege.

invitation already exists for a billing owner, please revoke that
invitation and then invite another user.

### Invite an existing collaborator to become billing owner

## Remove a billing owner

### Remove billing owner completely as a collaborator

Only the owner of a project can remove a collaborator with billing owner
privilege and take back the responsibility of billing for their project.

To remove a billing owner, click on the billing owner collaborator and
then click on the remove icon on the top right:

:::info Note

If the billing owner collaborator has other privileges apart from
`Billing Owner`, following the above steps will remove all those
privileges too. In case you only want to remove the `Billing Owner`
privilege, follow the steps under [Remove Billing Owner Privilege](#remove_bm_privilege).

### Remove only billing owner privilege for a collaborator {#remove_bm_privilege}

Only the owner of a project can remove a collaborator's billing owner
privilege and take back the responsibility of billing for their project.

To remove a collaborator's `Billing Owner` privilege, click on the
billing owner collaborator.
