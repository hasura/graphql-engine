==================================

Introduction
------------

One-off scheduled events are used to reliably trigger an HTTP webhook to run custom business logic at a particular point in time. For example, you can create a scheduled event to send a reminder email two weeks after a user signs up.

To add a one-off scheduled event, follow these steps:

Step 1: Navigate to One-off Scheduled Events
--------------------------------------------

- Go to the ``Events`` tab in your Hasura console.
- Click ``One-off Scheduled Events``.
- Click ``Schedule an event``.

Step 2: Define the scheduled event
----------------------------------

Define the following values for a scheduled event:

- **Webhook**: Enter the HTTP endpoint that should be triggered.
- **Time**: Enter the time to trigger the event.
- **Payload**: The JSON payload which will be sent to the webhook.

.. rst-class:: api_tabs
.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Console

      In the form opened by the above step, fill out the following fields:

         :width: 550px

   .. tab:: API

      You can define a scheduled event via the :ref:`create_scheduled_event metadata API <create_scheduled_event>`:

      .. code-block:: http

         POST /v1/query HTTP/1.1
         Content-Type: application/json
         X-Hasura-Role: admin

         {
            "type": "create_scheduled_event",
            "args": {
               "webhook": "https://send-email.com",
               "schedule_at": "2022-06-18T18:45:00Z",
               "payload": { "email": "bob@ross.com" }
            }
         }

Step 3: Define advanced options (Optional)
------------------------------------------

If you like, you can also define advanced values:

- **Headers**: List of headers to be sent to the webhook.
- **Retry configuration**: In case the call to the webhook fails.
- **Comment**: Custom description of the scheduled trigger.

.. rst-class:: api_tabs
.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Console

      Expand the ``Advanced`` section.

   .. tab:: API

      You can define advanced options when defining a scheduled event via the :ref:`create_scheduled_event metadata API <create_scheduled_event>`:

      .. code-block:: http

         POST /v1/query HTTP/1.1
         Content-Type: application/json
         X-Hasura-Role: admin

         {
            "type": "create_scheduled_event",
            "args": {
               "webhook": "https://send-email.com",
               "schedule_at": "2022-06-18T18:45:00Z",
               "payload": {
                     "email": "bob@ross.com"
               },
               "headers": [
                     {
                        "name": "key",
                        "value": "value"
                     }
               ],
               "retry_conf": {
                     "num_retries": 3,
                     "timeout_seconds": 120,
                     "tolerance_seconds": 21675,
                     "retry_interval_seconds": 12
               },
               "comment": "sample scheduled event comment"
            }
         }

Schedule & logs
---------------

Once you've created your scheduled trigger, you can see ``Pending events``, ``Processed events``, and ``Invocation logs`` in their respective tabs.

   :alt: Schedule and logs for scheduled events
   :width: 1200px

.. note::
   A scheduled event will be delivered within one minute of when it's scheduled.
   For example, if you schedule an event at ``09:24:10``, it will be delivered between ``09:24:10`` and ``09:25:10``.
   
   This is because Hasura currently checks for events to be delivered at 1 minute intervals. This interval will be made configurable soon.
