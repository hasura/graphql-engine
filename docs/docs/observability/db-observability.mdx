# Database Observability

The purpose of this document is to provide an overview of how to configure database observability. The scope covers
configuring the observability tools for the database host and database. While the specifics of this guide may vary
depending on the host, database, and other aspects of your deployment, we have used Hasura Cloud and a self-hosted
(Ubuntu) Postgres database.

## The basics

Diagnosing and troubleshooting issues in an application can be challenging when a database is involved, thereby making
database observability and telemetry critical. When you combine telemetry with application context, database instances
become more observable and manageable. You can quickly spot problems and troubling trends and address them without
costly downtime. Additionally, by using such information, you can set up newer database instances to start collecting
the appropriate data immediately. Database observability allows you to:

- View query metrics and explain plans in a single location.
- Quickly locate slow-performing or costly queries.
- Drill down into execution details of costly queries.
- Correlate query and host metrics to understand whether you are constrained by resources.

## Agent installation

Installing an agent applies to the host where you have your database running. This step is irrelevant if you are not
using your own hosted (on-premises or cloud) database. For this guide, we use Datadog and a self-hosted Postgres
database. Refer to [this](https://docs.datadoghq.com/database_monitoring/) link to install the Datadog agent for your DB
and DB host.

Making sure your agent has the correct permissions for your database metrics is vital. You should refer to the
observability platformâ€™s integration documents to enable the proper permissions. Different databases store metrics and
data in their custom tables, but you generally provide the observability agent with the necessary access to the correct
tables.

In this example, we will use Postgres and Datadog:

Log into a `psql` session as a user who has
[CREATEROLE privileges](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/app-createuser.html), create a `datadog`user and
password, and grant it read access to `pg_stat_database.`

```
create user datadog with password '<PASSWORD>';
grant SELECT ON pg_stat_database to datadog;
```

If you use PostgreSQL version `10.x` or later, you can provide the Datadog user access to monitoring-related statistics
and configuration options typically only available to superusers. `grant pg_monitor to datadog;`

Verify that the agent installation is successful and the Datadog user can access your metrics by running:

`psql -h <server> -U datadog postgres -c \ "select * from pg_stat_database LIMIT(1);" && echo -e "\e[0;32mPostgres connection - OK\e[0m" || \ || echo -e "\e[0;31mCannot connect to Postgres\e[0m"`

### Configure the agent to collect PostgreSQL metrics

You should create a configuration file that gives the agent the details it requires to start gathering data. The
platform that hosts your database determines the location of these files. For further information, please see your
observability agent's documentation.

In the following example, we tell the agent to utilize the newly generated Datadog user and password to view metrics
locally over port `5432`. Additionally, you have the choice to limit metric collection to particular schemas and to add
custom tags to your PostgreSQL metrics.

```
init_config:

instances:
  - host: localhost
    port: 5432
    username: datadog
    password: <PASSWORD>
    tags:
      - optional_tag
```

### Detect and optimize slow queries

You'll need to add a few settings to your setup and give your observability agent a few extra permissions if you want to
go even further and gain query-level performance insights with your observability platform. Please refer to your
platform and agent documentation for the exact configurations. In the following example, we will enable advanced
permissions for Datadog on Postgres:

```
init_config:
instances:
  - dbm: true
    host: localhost
    port: 5432
    username: datadog
    password: <PASSWORD>
    tags:
      - optional_tag
```

With this configuration change, you have now enabled the option to track all normalized queries on your Datadog console.
You can now see comprehensive explanation plans for each normalized query that reveal the precise Actions the query
planner used to carry out the query, along with their anticipated costs. You can also create time-series graphs of
normalized query performance indicators, allowing you to track long-term trends.

## Building an observability dashboard with Datadog

The most effective dashboards you create are with your audience in mind. When you organize information in a way where
the most critical elements occupy the prime space and most components are interactive enough to allow drill-downs, you
deliver the most value and insight into your platform and its performance.

An ideal observability dashboard should contain the following:

- Structured raw events.
- Persistent context through the event path.
- Ordered dimensions for traceability.
- Dynamic sampling.
- Visual elements arranged in a logical manner.
- Data refreshed as close to real-time as possible.
- Indexes or schemas avoided when possible.
- Plan for fast load times, use live connection for streaming data.
