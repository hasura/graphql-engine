# BigQuery: Computed fields

## What are computed fields?

Computed fields are virtual fields that are dynamically computed and can be
queried along with a table's columns. Computed fields are computed upon request.
They are computed by executing user-defined SQL functions using other columns of
the table and other custom inputs if needed.

:::info Note

Computed fields are only exposed over the GraphQL API and the BigQuery database
schema is not modified on addition of a computed field.

:::

### Supported SQL functions

Currently, only [table-valued functions](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/table-functions),
which return a table, can be added as computed fields. Support for computed fields that return
a scalar type is being tracked in this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/issues/8521).

#### Creating a table-valued function {#bigquery-create-table-function}

A table-valued function can be created using the [`CREATE TABLE FUNCTION`](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/data-definition-language#create_table_function_statement)
SQL statement. BigQuery infers the returning table type based on the `RETURNS TABLE<..>` syntax present in
the SQL statement.

- If `RETURNS TABLE` is included, it specifies the custom schema of the return table as a comma-separated list
  of column name and data type pairs. While [adding such functions as computed fields](#bigquery-adding-computed-field),
  it is not required to provide `return_table` in the [definition](/graphql/core/api-reference/syntax-defs.mdx#bigquerycomputedfielddefinition)
  as BigQuery [provides enough information](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/routines#Routine) about
  the returning table schema to Hasura.

  Example:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE FUNCTION `google_project.hasura_test.fetch_articles`(a_id INT64, search STRING)
  RETURNS TABLE<id INT64, title STRING, content STRING> AS (
      ( SELECT t.id, t.title, t.content
           FROM hasura_test.article t
           WHERE t.author_id = a_id AND (t.title like `search` or t.content like `search`)
      )
  );
  ```

- If `RETURNS TABLE` is absent, BigQuery infers the returning table from the query statement
  present in the function body, implicitly. While [adding such functions as computed fields](#bigquery-adding-computed-field),
  it is required to provide `return_table` in the [definition](/graphql/core/api-reference/syntax-defs.mdx#bigquerycomputedfielddefinition)
  as BigQuery does not provide any information about the returning table to Hasura.

  Example:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE FUNCTION `google_project.hasura_test.fetch_articles`(a_id INT64, search STRING) AS (
      ( SELECT t.*
           FROM hasura_test.article t
           WHERE t.author_id = a_id AND (t.title like `search` or t.content like `search`)
      )
  );
  ```

  :::info Note
  
  Table functions without `RETURNS TABLE` should return all columns, possibly by using  the`*` operator,
  to avoid any execution exceptions when a column that is not being returned is included in the selection set of
  computed field.

## Adding computed fields to a table {#bigquery-adding-computed-field}

<Tabs className="api-tabs">

<TabItem value="console" label="Console">

  Console support will be added soon.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

You can add a computed field by updating the `metadata > databases > [db-name] > tables > [table_name].yaml` file:

```yaml {4-15}
- table:
    dataset: hasura
    name: authors
  computed_fields:
  - name: fetch_articles
    definition:
      function:
        dataset: hasura
        name: search_articles
      return_table:
        dataset: hasura
        name: articles
      argument_mapping:
        author_id_arg: author_id
    comment: ""
```

Apply the metadata by running:

```bash
hasura metadata apply
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="api" label="API">

A computed field can be added to a table using the
[bigquery_add_computed_field](/graphql/core/api-reference/metadata-api/computed-field.mdx#metadata-bigquery-add-computed-field) metadata API:

```http
POST /v1/metadata HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
X-Hasura-Role: admin

{
  "type": "bigquery_add_computed_field",
  "args": {
    "source": "<db_name>",
    "table": {
      "name": "author",
      "dataset": "hasura"
    },
    "name": "fetch_articles",
    "definition": {
      "function": {
        "name": "fetch_articles",
        "dataset": "hasura"
      },
      "return_table": {
        "name": "article",
        "dataset": "hasura"
      },
      "argument_mapping": {
        "author_id_arg": "author_id"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Computed fields permissions

[Access control](/graphql/core/auth/authorization/index.mdx) to computed fields depends on the presence of the `RETURNS TABLE` clause
in the [creating computed field](#bigquery-create-table-function) SQL statement.

If `RETURNS TABLE`
- is present, then the function returns a custom table schema. Select permissions are managed through `computed_fields`
in the [permission definition](/graphql/core/api-reference/syntax-defs.mdx#selectpermission).
- is absent, then the permissions set on `return_table` are respected.
