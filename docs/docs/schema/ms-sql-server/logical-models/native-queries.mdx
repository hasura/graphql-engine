## What are Native Queries?

:::tip Supported from

Native queries are supported from `v2.26.0`.

:::

The Hasura GraphQL Engine automatically generates a GraphQL API around database objects. That includes querying,
mutating, and subscribing to data changes and events. However, sometimes we need more custom or advanced behavior that
doesn’t come out of the box.

Native Queries allows you to automatically generate a GraphQL API around raw SQL queries, giving you more flexibility
and control over your Hasura-generated GraphQL schema. They allow you to harness the full power of SQL within Hasura
without the need to create database objects that require DDL privileges.

You might find Native Queries useful for many reasons:

- Use the full power of SQL that Hasura might not provide access to through the typical table API, such as `GROUP BY`,
  window functions, or scalar functions.
- Provide custom arguments to the users of your API to greatly expand its flexibility.
- Encapsulate sophisticated filtering with a query, allowing your users to provide a single argument rather than having
  to understand how to manipulate the data.
- Work with the advanced features of your database to improve performance.
- Write a compatibility layer around tables, making it easier to change your API without breaking existing clients.
- Reduce duplication by moving common data manipulation into one place.

Native Queries are a Cloud and Enterprise feature of Hasura.

:::info Supported features

Currently, Hasura aggregations are not supported, but you can write the aggregation yourself as part of the query.

Relationships will be supported in a future release.

:::

## Example: excerpts of articles

We’ll start with an example. Let’s use this new feature to add some custom functionality to our Hasura API, without
needing to define a custom SQL function on the database. If you’d like some reference documentation, scroll down, and
also take a look at the [Logical Models documentation](/schema/ms-sql-server/logical-models/index.mdx).

Imagine we have some articles in a table, with content kindly donated by [Loripsum.net](https://loripsum.net/):

```sql
CREATE TABLE article(
  id SERIAL NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  date DATE NOT NULL,
  content TEXT NOT NULL
);

INSERT INTO article(title, date, content) VALUES
  ('You will not believe', '2023-01-01', 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Facillimum id quidem est, inquam. Esse enim, nisi eris, non potes. Oratio me istius philosophi non offendit; Idemne, quod iucunde? Quid est enim aliud esse versutum? Non autem hoc: igitur ne illud quidem.'),
  ('Ten things that', '2023-02-02', 'Illi enim inter se dissentiunt. Sedulo, inquam, faciam. Simus igitur contenti his.'),
  ('Did you know', '2023-03-03', 'Ratio quidem vestra sic cogit. Duo Reges: constructio interrete. An nisi populari fama? Erat enim res aperta. Apparet statim, quae sint officia, quae actiones. Tum mihi Piso: Quid ergo?'),
  ('They just cannot', '2023-04-04', 'Itaque hic ipse iam pridem est reiectus; Quod quidem iam fit etiam in Academia. Negare non possum. Quis non odit sordidos, vanos, leves, futtiles?'),
  ('What on earth', '2023-05-05', 'Venit ad extremum; At certe gravius. Efficiens dici potest. Rhetorice igitur, inquam, nos mavis quam dialectice disputare? Nunc de hominis summo bono quaeritur; Rationis enim perfectio est virtus;');
```

When listing these articles in an index, we probably want to truncate the text to, let’s say, 20 characters. So let’s
create a Logical Model representing the excerpted article:

:::info Only creatable via the API

Currently, Native Queries can only be created using the API. Console and CLI support will be added in a future release.

:::

<Tabs groupId="user-preference" className="api-tabs">
<TabItem value="api" label="API">

```http
POST /v1/metadata HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
X-Hasura-Role: admin

{
  "type": "mssql_track_logical_model",
  "args": {
    "source": "default",
    "name": "article_excerpt",
    "fields": [
      {
        "name": "id",
        "type": "integer"
      },
      {
        "name": "title",
        "type": "text"
      },
      {
        "name": "date",
        "type": "date"
      },
      {
        "name": "excerpt",
        "type": "text"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

We can then track a Native Query that takes a single argument, `max_length`, and uses it to truncate the article content
(more on arguments below). We use the SQL `substring` function to truncate the function, and the `length` function to
decide whether we should use an ellipsis.

We use `{{max_length}}` to refer to the argument. We need it twice, so we simply use the argument twice.

<Tabs groupId="user-preference" className="api-tabs">
<TabItem value="api" label="API">

```http
POST /v1/metadata HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
X-Hasura-Role: admin

{
  "type": "mssql_track_native_query",
  "args": {
    "type": "query",
    "source": "default",
    "root_field_name": "article_with_excerpt",
    "arguments": {
      "max_length": {
        "type": "integer"
      }
    },
    "returns": "article_excerpt",
    "code": "SELECT id, title, (substring(content, 1, {{max_length}}) || (CASE WHEN length(content) < {{max_length}} THEN '' else '...' END)) AS excerpt, date FROM article"
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

All that’s left is for us to make a GraphQL query to select some articles with excerpts using our new root field
generated in the previous API call. All we need to provide is the date range we’re interested in:

```graphql
query {
  article_with_excerpt(args: { max_length: 20 }, where: { date: { _gte: "2023-03-01" } }) {
    id
    title
    date
    excerpt
  }
}
```

When we run this GraphQL query, we get the following results:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "article_with_excerpt": [
      {
        "id": 3,
        "title": "Did you know",
        "date": "2023-03-03",
        "excerpt": "Ratio quidem vestra ..."
      },
      {
        "id": 4,
        "title": "They just cannot",
        "date": "2023-04-04",
        "excerpt": "Itaque hic ipse iam ..."
      },
      {
        "id": 5,
        "title": "What on earth",
        "date": "2023-05-05",
        "excerpt": "Venit ad extremum; A..."
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Creating a Native Query

### 1. Create a Logical Model

In order to represent the structure of the data returned by the query, we first create a Logical Model.

:::info Permissions and Logical Models

Note that this Logical Model has no attached permissions and therefore will only be available to the admin account. See
the [Logical Model documentation](/schema/ms-sql-server/logical-models/index.mdx) for information on attaching
permissions.

:::

<Tabs groupId="user-preference" className="api-tabs">
<TabItem value="api" label="API">

```http
POST /v1/metadata HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
X-Hasura-Role: admin

{
  "type": "mssql_track_logical_model",
  "args": {
    "source": "default",
    "name": "<name>",
    "fields": [
      {
        "name": "<field name>",
        "type": "<SQL Server field type>",
        "nullable": false | true,
        "description": "<optional field description>"
      },
      ...
    ]
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 2. Create a Native Query

Once the Logical Model is defined, we can use it to define the query:

<Tabs groupId="user-preference" className="api-tabs">
<TabItem value="api" label="API">

```http
POST /v1/metadata HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
X-Hasura-Role: admin

{
  "type": "mssql_track_native_query",
  "args": {
    "source": "default",
    "root_field_name": "<name>",
    "type": "query",
    "arguments": {
      "<name>": {
        "type": "<SQL Server field type>",
        "nullable": false | true,
        "description": "<optional field description>"
      }
    },
    "array_relationships": [
      {
        "name": "<relationship name>",
        "using": {
          "column_mapping": {
            "<local column>": "<remote column>"
          },
          "remote_native_query: "<remote native query name>"
        }
      }
    ],
    "object_relationships": <same as array_relationships>,
    "description": "<text>",
    "code": "<SQL query>",
    "returns": "<logical model name>"
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

You can use any SQL that you could potentially use in a parameterized query, with the following caveats:

- The query must currently be a single read-only SQL query.
- The query must be a valid standalone query, and not a partial query.
- The return type of the query must match with the Logical Model.
- The SQL cannot invoke a stored procedure.

#### Arguments

The query can take arguments, which are specified in the metadata. These arguments can be used in the SQL using the
syntax `{{argument_name}}`. This syntax resembles popular string templating languages such as Mustache, but does not use
string interpolation. Instead, it works in exactly the same way as prepared statements in the database, and so arguments
do not need escaping or quoting in the SQL itself. They will be treated as variables of the correct type.

This does mean that arguments cannot be used for elements of the SQL that deal with structure. For example, you cannot
use an argument to specify the name of the table in a `FROM` clause.

When making a query, the arguments are specified using the `args` parameter of the query root field.

## Using the Native Query

You can make a GraphQL request using the specified root field name just as you would any other GraphQL query. When
making a query, the arguments are specified using the `args` parameter of the query root field.

```graphql
query {
  <root field name>(
    [args: {"<argument name>": <argument value>, ...},]
    [where: ...,]
    [order_by: ..., distinct_on: ...,]
    [limit: ..., offset: ...]
  ) {
    <field 1>
    <field 2>
    ...
  }
}
```

## Query functionality

Just like tables, native queries generate GraphQL types with the ability to further break down the data. You can find
more information in the relevant documentation for [filtering](/queries/ms-sql-server/query-filters.mdx),
[sorting](/queries/ms-sql-server/sorting.mdx), and [pagination](/queries/ms-sql-server/pagination.mdx).

Subscriptions (live queries) are also supported as usual.

## Mutations

Currently, only read-only queries are supported. All queries are run in a read-only transaction where supported to
enforce this constraint.

A future release will allow mutations to be specified using native queries.

## Permissions

Native queries will inherit the permissions of the Logical Model that they return. See the
[documentation on Logical Models](/schema/ms-sql-server/logical-models/index.mdx) for an explanation of how to add
permissions.

## Relationships

Relationships are supported between Native Queries.
This is how Native Queries may implement object and array fields of their referenced Logical Model.

Unlike tables, relationships for a Native Query have to be given as part of
tracking the Native Query: The schema of a Native Query is defined by its
Logical Model, and the Native Query needs to implement all the fields of the
Logical Model in order to be tracked successfully.

Currently relationships are only supported between Native Queries residing in the same source.

As an example, consider the following Native Queries which implement the data
model of articles and authors given in the section on [Logical Model references](/schema/ms-sql-server/logical-models/index.mdx#referencing-other-logical-models):

      "type": "mssql_track_native_query"

  ]
}
```

:::info Wrap calls in `bulk_atomic`

Similar to Logical Models, tracking the Native Queries one-by-one would fail,
since `get_articles` refers to `get_authors`, which is not yet defined.

Tracking the Native Queries in one atomic operation postpones coherency checks
until all models are tracked, which allows for mutual references.
