# Build a GraphQL Backend

## Overview

This guide, and the others contained in this directory, are intended to be a step-by-step resource to build an
application using Hasura. If you arrived here from the Hasura Cloud Console, you'll have already created a project and
are ready to follow the steps below. If you're here from elsewhere, you can create a
[Hasura Cloud project](https://cloud.hasura.io?skip_onboarding=true) for free and get started right away.

### What we're building

<Thumbnail src="/img/use-case-overview/gql-backend.svg" alt="Hasura GraphQL Backend overview" width="600px" />

The application we will be building is a simple to-do app, but the concepts and techniques we will be using apply to any
GraphQL backend.

If you're a developer who's attempted to create your own GraphQL backend from scratch, you know the challenges that come
with it. From writing resolvers and setting up authorization, to handling subscriptions, it can be a time-consuming and
tedious process. However, Hasura provides a solution to this problem by delivering a GraphQL backend instantly, and with
a few simple steps. In a matter of minutes, you can have a fully-functional GraphQL backend that doesn't require you to
write a single line of code and will save you countless hours of development time.

In the example below, we'll create a backend for a to-do app. This app will allow users to create to-do items, mark them
as complete, and delete them. Using Hasura's built-in permissions system, we'll also allow users to only see their own
to-do items and dial in granular permissions for each user. Once we've checked-off the must-haves for our app, we'll
also add some enhanced capabilities like instantly integrating with existing REST and GraphQL APIs.

By the end of this guide, you'll have a GraphQL backend that you can translate into your own application.

## Fully-functional backend

Steps 1 through 5 will cover everything needed to create a fully-functional GraphQL backend.

### Step 1. Connect a database

Every application needs a database to store its data. Typically, this is a time-consuming process that requires you to
search for a database provider, create an account, and then provision a database. However, Hasura makes this process
instant and easy. With a few clicks, you can spin up a database and connect it to your Hasura project. We have a
partnership with Neon, a cloud database provider, that allows you to instantly provision a serverless Postgres database
and connect it to your Hasura project.

From your project's Console - the UI that allows you to interact with your Hasura instance - navigate to the `Data` tab
and click `Connect New Database`. From here, you'll be able to select Neon as your database provider and provision a
database. Once you've done that, we'll automatically connect it to your Hasura project.

<Thumbnail

  alt="Creating a Neon database from the Hasura Console"
  width="1000px"
/>

:::info Connect databases from other providers

Using Neon is a quick and easy way to get started, but you can also connect databases from other hosts. If you're
interested to see what the process looks like, check out our [guides](/databases/overview.mdx#supported-databases) for
many of the most popular providers.

:::

### Step 2. Create a data model

After connecting a database, we'll then need to create a data model. This is the process of creating tables and
relationships between them. In our example, we'll create a `users` table and a `todos` table. We'll also create a
relationship between them so that each user can have many to-do items.

While we could create these tables and relationships manually using a database management tool, Hasura makes this
process easy with the `Data` tab in the Console. From here, we can create tables and relationships with a few clicks. In
the example below, let's create the `users` table by entering the fields and types from the diagram above. Your finished
product should look like this:

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/resources/use-case/gql-backend/users-table-details.png"
  alt="Details for users table creation"
  width="1000px"
/>

After entering the information, click `Create` and Hasura will create the table for us.

If we're feeling adventurous, we can even write SQL and execute it directly in the Console. This allows us to input a
tremendous amount of seed data in just a flash. To access the SQL editor, click the `SQL` option in the sidebar on the
`Data` tab.

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/resources/use-case/gql-backend/run-sql.png"
  alt="Running SQL in the Hasura Console"
  width="1000px"
/>

From here, copy and paste the following SQL into the Console and execute it to create the `todos` and seed data for both
tables:

```sql
CREATE TABLE todos (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255),
    description TEXT,
    is_completed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES "users" (id)
);

ALTER TABLE "users" ADD COLUMN country VARCHAR(255);

INSERT INTO "users" (name, email, password, country) VALUES
    ('John', 'john@example.com', 'password123', 'US'),
    ('Jane', 'jane@example.com', 'password456', 'GB');

INSERT INTO todos (title, description, user_id) VALUES
    ('Buy groceries', 'Milk, eggs, bread', 1),
    ('Clean apartment', 'Vacuum, dust, do laundry', 1),
    ('Finish project', 'Complete tasks A, B, and C', 2),
    ('Schedule meeting', 'With client X', 2);
```

:::info It's your choice!

Hasura gives you the flexibility to create our data model in whichever way you prefer. Whether you - or people in your
team - are more comfortable with a GUI or with SQL, Hasura has you covered to help you quickly create or modify your
data model and get back to building your application.

:::

The final thing we'll do is create relationships between the tables. This will allow us to query data from both tables
in a single query. To do this, navigate to the `Data` tab and click the `Track All` button above the untracked
foreign-key relationships:

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/resources/use-case/gql-backend/track-all-relationships.png"
  alt="Tracking all relationships in the Hasura Console"
  width="1000px"
/>

### Step 3. Query data

With our data model created, and seed data in place, we can now query our data. With traditional tools, this would
require us to write resolvers and set up a GraphQL server. However, Hasura makes this process instant and easy. With a
few clicks, we can query our data and get back the results we need.

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/resources/use-case/gql-backend/query-AllUsersAndTodos.png"
  alt="Querying all users and their to-do items"
  width="1000px"
/>

We achieved the example above by querying all of the users and their to-do items. We can do this with the **GraphiQL
Explorer**, which is a tool that allows us to execute queries, mutations, and subscriptions. To access the GraphiQL
Explorer, navigate to the `API` tab. We can build a query using the Explorer by clicking on the fields we want to
return, or we can write the query manually.

<GraphiQLIDE
  query={`query AllUsersAndTodos {
  users {
    id
    name
    todos {
      id
      title
      is_completed
    }
  }
}
`}
  response={`{
  "data": {
    "users": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "John",
        "todos": [
          {
            "id": 1,
            "title": "Buy groceries",
            "is_completed": false
          },
          {
            "id": 2,
            "title": "Clean apartment",
            "is_completed": false
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "id": 2,
        "name": "Jane",
        "todos": [
          {
            "id": 3,
            "title": "Finish project",
            "is_completed": false
          },
          {
            "id": 4,
            "title": "Schedule meeting",
            "is_completed": false
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}`}
/>

:::info That's an instant GraphQL API 🚀

While we executed some SQL, we didn't have to write a single line of code to create a GraphQL API. Hasura automatically
creates a GraphQL schema based on the tables and relationships we created. This means we can instantly query our data!

:::

### Step 4. Set up authorization

One of the most important - and painfully difficult - aspects of any application is authorization. This is the process
of ensuring that users can only access the data that they are allowed to access. If we were building this API ourselves,
we would need to write a lot of code to handle this. However, Hasura ships with a robust permissions system that allows
us to dial in granular permissions for each user. With a few clicks, we can set up permissions that will ensure that
users can only access their own to-do items.

#### Query data with permissions

To do this, we'll create a `user` role and set up permissions for that role. We'll create a rule that checks if a user's
ID is equal to the ID of the user who created the to-do item. If it is, we'll allow them to access it. If it isn't,
we'll deny them access.

To do this, navigate to the `Data` tab and choose our `todos` table. Then, click the `Permissions` tab. From here, we'll
name the role `user` by entering it into the input and then clicking on the `select` column:

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/resources/use-case/gql-backend/navigate-to-permissions-tab-for-todos.png"
  alt="Navigating to the permissions tab for the todos table"
  width="1000px"
/>

Once in the editor, we'll select `With custom check` and write the check to reflect the rule we described above. The GUI
allows you to build a rule using a series of dropdowns, but we can also write it manually. You can copy and paste the
following into the editor:

```graphql
{"user_id":{"_eq":"X-Hasura-User-Id"}}
```

There's a series of other configuration options that we can set up, but for now, we'll simply choose `Toggle All` for
the columns in the `todos` table someone with the `user` role can access. Once we've done that, we can click
`Save Permissions` and Hasura will automatically modify our GraphQL schema to reflect the changes we made.

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/resources/use-case/gql-backend/set-todos-permissions.png"
  alt="Setting permissions for the todos table"
  width="1000px"
/>

Now that we've set up permissions, let's test them out. We'll use the GraphiQL Explorer to query the to-do items for a
user with admin privileges and then for a user with `user` privileges. If you run the following query, you should see an
output - being the to-do items of all users - like this:

<GraphiQLIDE
  query={`query AllTodos {
  todos {
    id
    title
    is_completed
  }
}
`}
  response={`{
  "data": {
    "todos": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "title": "Buy groceries",
        "is_completed": false
      },
      {
        "id": 2,
        "title": "Clean apartment",
        "is_completed": false
      },
      {
        "id": 3,
        "title": "Finish project",
        "is_completed": false
      },
      {
        "id": 4,
        "title": "Schedule meeting",
        "is_completed": false
      }
    ]
  }
}`}
/>

Of course, we can see all of the to-do items because we have admin privileges. **These are enabled in our GraphiQL
Explorer because we have the `x-hasura-admin` secret header included.** By adding two new headers, we can test out the
permissions we just set up. Add the following and check yourself against the screenshot before executing the query:

| Header             | Value |
| ------------------ | ----- |
| `x-hasura-role`    | user  |
| `x-hasura-user-id` | 1     |

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/resources/use-case/gql-backend/run-todos-with-headers.png"
  alt="Running the todos query with headers"
  width="1000px"
/>

If you make this change and then run the query again, you should see an output like this:

<GraphiQLIDE
  query={`query AllTodos {
  todos {
    id
    title
    is_completed
  }
}
`}
  response={`{
  "data": {
    "todos": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "title": "Buy groceries",
        "is_completed": false
      },
      {
        "id": 2,
        "title": "Clean apartment",
        "is_completed": false
      }
    ]
  }
}`}
/>

Let's break down what's happening here. We're simulating a user with the ID of `1` making a request to the API. Hasura
is agnostic about how you handle authentication, but it can decode user information stored in the header of a request.
In this case, we're using the `Authorization` header to pass in the user ID. Hasura then checks the permissions we set
up and determines that the user with the ID of `1` should only be able to access the to-do items that they created.

:::info Wait, we used the same query and returned different results?

Yep! Hasura automatically modifies the schema to reflect the permissions a particular role can access. This means you
can write a clean, simple query and Hasura will handle the rest 🎉

:::

#### Mutate data with permissions

Now that we've set up permissions for querying data, let's set up permissions for mutating data. We'll create a rule
that checks if a user's ID is equal to the ID of the user who is creating the to-do item. If it is, we'll allow them to
create it. If it isn't, we'll deny them access.

To do this, navigate to the `Data` tab and choose our `todos` table. Then, click the `Permissions` tab. From here, we'll
click the ❌ in the `Insert` column on the `user` row. Since this is the same logic we used for querying data, Hasura
can apply the same rules to inserts; choose `With same custom check as select`.

Under the `Column insert permissions`, we could choose `Toggle All`, however, Hasura can automatically determine values
for different fields using column presets. As an added layer of security, we'll restrict a user's ability to set the
`user_id` field.

For now, let's only select `title` under `Column insert permissions`. Then, under `Column presets`, we'll choose
`user_id` for the name of the column, `from session variable` for the preset type, and `Hasura-User-Id` for the session
variable.

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/resources/use-case/gql-backend/set-todos-insert-permissions.png"
  alt="Setting permissions for the todos table"
  width="1000px"
/>

Now that we've set up permissions, let's test them out. We'll use the GraphiQL Explorer to create a to-do item for a
user with an id of `1`. If you run the following mutation, you should see an output - being the to-do item that was
created - like this:

<GraphiQLIDE
  query={`mutation CreateTodo {
  insert_todos_one(object: {title: "Clean the car"}) {
    id
    title
    is_completed
    user_id
  }
}
`}
  response={`{
  "data": {
    "insert_todos_one": {
      "id": 5,
      "title": "Clean the car",
      "is_completed": false,
      "user_id": 1
    }
  }
}`}
/>

:::info Simplifying the DX for your team

Because Hasura not only leverages the power of native database constructs, but also allows you to determine presets for
different fields, you can simplify the DX for your team by allowing them to write clean, simple queries and mutations
without having to worry about the underlying logic.

:::

### Step 5. Add custom business logic

A common need for any backend is to add custom business logic. This is the process of adding custom code to your backend
to handle a specific use case. For bespoke needs that are unique to your application, you don't need an entire backend
to handle them. Instead, you can use Hasura Actions to add custom business logic to your API. True, the handlers
executing the logic are running on a separate server, but they can be written in the language and framework of your
choice and hosted wherever you like. Simply point Hasura to the endpoint and it will handle the rest.

In the example below, we'll create an Action that will hash a user's password when they sign up. To begin, let's write a
mutation that will create a user and return their ID and name. We'll use the GraphiQL Explorer to do this.

:::info Before we begin

Ensure you've unchecked the `x-hasura-role` and `x-hasura-user-id` headers in the GraphiQL Explorer.

:::

If you run the following mutation, you should see an output - being the user that was created - like this:

<GraphiQLIDE
  query={`mutation CreateUser($name: String!, $email: String!, $password: String!) {
  insert_users_one(object: {name: $name, email: $email, password: $password}) {
    id
    name
  }
}`}
  variables={`{ "name": "Jack", "email": "jack@example.com", "password": "password789" }`}
  response={`{
  "data": {
    "insert_users_one": {
      "id": 3,
      "name": "Jack"
    }
  }
}`}
/>

Now that we've confirmed our mutation works, let's create an Action that will hash a new user's password before entering
it into the database. To do this, click `Derive action` in the GraphiQL Explorer:

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/resources/use-case/gql-backend/derive-action.png"
  alt="Deriving an action from a mutation"
  width="1000px"
/>

Hasura automatically picks up the context of the mutation we just wrote and uses it to populate the Action. As you can
see from the screenshot below, it's named the mutation `CreateUser` and defined an output type of `CreateUserOutput`.
It's also automatically populated the arguments with the fields we used in the mutation. This means when we run this
mutation, we'll get back the ID and name of the user that was created.

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/resources/use-case/gql-backend/action-definition-and-config.png"
  alt="Action definition and configuration"
  width="1000px"
/>

Next, we'll enter a webhook URL. This is the endpoint that Hasura will hit when the Action is executed. We've created a
simple endpoint that will hash the password and return the user's ID and name. You can copy and paste the following into
the input:

```bash
https://us-central1-websitecloud-352908.cloudfunctions.net/docs-action-hash
```

As we're handling the logic for you, you'll also need to add a couple of headers so our handler can access your
project's API. Add the following in the `Headers` section of the Action:

| Key                     | Value                                             |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `hasura-endpoint`       | https://<YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>.hasura.app/v1/graphql |
| `x-hasura-admin-secret` | <YOUR_PROJECT_SECRET>                             |

Check yourself against this screenshot before moving on:

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/resources/use-case/gql-backend/action-headers.png"
  alt="Action headers set to hit the endpoint"
  width="1000px"
/>

If everything is in place, we can now click `Create Action` and test it out. If you run the following mutation in the
GraphiQL Explorer of the `API` tab, you should see an output - being the user that was created - like this:

<GraphiQLIDE
  query={`mutation MyMutation($email: String!, $name: String!, $password: String!) {
  CreateUser(email: $email, name: $name, password: $password) {
    id
    name
  }
}`}
  variables={`{ "name": "Jim", "email": "jim@example.com", "password": "password007" }`}
  response={`{
  "data": {
    "insert_users_one": {
      "id": 5,
      "name": "Jim"
    }
  }
}`}
/>

If you head to the `Data` tab and choose the `users` table, you should see the user that was created and the password
hashed:

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/resources/use-case/gql-backend/new-user-hashed.png"
  alt="New user with hashed password"
  width="1000px"
/>

:::info Make your own endpoints

As this is a demo, we've created the simple endpoint for you. However, in production, you'll need to create your own
endpoints that can handle the logic you need. Check out our [codegen docs](/actions/codegen/index.mdx) for more
information on how to do this.

**Additionally, you should never pass your project secret in the headers of a request in a production environment.**

:::

If you've reached this point and followed along with everything, you should be proud! You've just created a GraphQL API
with Hasura that can handle all of your CRUD operations and execute custom business logic. You can now use this API to
build your frontend and focus on what matters most - building your product. 🎉

## Enhanced capabilities

While everything covered above is enough to get you up and running with a GraphQL API, Hasura has a number of enhanced
capabilities that can help you build a robust backend. In this section, we'll cover some of the most common use-cases
and how you can use Hasura to solve them. We'll also provide links to more in-depth documentation so you can learn more.

### Step 6. Execute event-driven logic

It's common to have event-driven logic in your application. For example, when a new user signs up, you may want to send
them a welcome email. With Hasura, you can execute event-triggered logic by creating a trigger that will hit an endpoint
when a new user is created. We call these [**Event Triggers**](/event-triggers/overview.mdx). Similar to Actions, you
can point these Event Triggers at endpoints that you host anywhere and execute any logic you wish whenever a prescribed
database event occurs.

<Player src="/img/resources/use-case/gql-backend/event-triggers.webm" />

<details>
  <summary>Show me how to do this</summary>
  <div>

In this example, we're simulating sending a welcome email by creating an Event Trigger that will hit an endpoint when a
new user is created. To do this, navigate to the `Events` tab and click `Create Trigger`. Then, choose `users` as the
table and `insert` as the operation. Finally, we'll enter the endpoint below as the `Webhook`:

```bash
http://httpbin.org/post
```

We can now click `Save Trigger` and test it out. Try inserting a new user in the GraphiQL Explorer. Then, if you head to
the `Events` tab, you can see a log of the event that was triggered.

  </div>
</details>

### Step 7. Incorporate an existing REST API

Often, you'll have an existing REST API that you want to incorporate into your GraphQL API. With Hasura, you can do this
with [**Actions**](/actions/overview.mdx). This allows you to add a GraphQL wrapper around routes in your REST API and
use them as if they were native GraphQL queries and mutations. Suppose you have a REST API that returns the location of
an IP address. You can create an Action that will hit the endpoint and return the location of the IP address whenever
the Action is executed.

<Player src="/img/resources/use-case/gql-backend/rest-action.webm" />

<details>
  <summary>Show me how to do this</summary>
  <div>

Navigate to the `Actions` tab and click `Create Action`. Then, enter the following information:

Add the description:

```plaintext
Translate ip addresses to city names.
```

Then, the Action Definition:

```graphql
type Query {
  GetCityName(ip: String!): City
}
```

Followed by the Type Configuration:

```graphql
type City {
  city: String!
}
```

We'll then hit the handler at the following endpoint:

```bash
https://api.techniknews.net/ipgeo
```

And finally Transform the Request Options by selecting `GET` and adding the following to the base url:

```plaintext
/{{$body.input.ip}}
```

We can now click `Create Action` and test it out. If you run the following query, you should see an output - being the
city of Boston - like this:

```graphql
query MyQuery {
  GetCityName(ip: "43.225.189.85") {
    city
  }
}
```

  </div>
</details>

### Step 8. Incorporate an existing GraphQL API

We've seen how to handle custom business logic and REST APIs, but what if you have an existing GraphQL API? With Hasura,
you can incorporate an existing GraphQL API into your backend using [**Remote Schemas**](/remote-schemas/overview.mdx).
This allows you to have a single GraphQL API that can handle all of your needs. Imagine we have a `country` field on our
`users` table. We can create a Remote Schema that will point to an existing GraphQL API that will return the emoji flag
for a given country. We can then create a relationship between the `users` table and the Remote Schema so that when we
query a user, we can also get their country's emoji flag.

<Player src="/img/resources/use-case/gql-backend/remote-schemas.webm" />

<details>
  <summary>Show me how to do this</summary>
  <div>

To begin, we'll create a Remote Schema that will point to the GraphQL API. To do this, navigate to the `Remote Schemas`
tab and click `Add`. We'll call our Remote Schema `countries` and then, enter the following endpoint:

```bash
https://countries.trevorblades.com/graphql
```

We can now click `Add Remote Schema` and create our relationships.

From the `Data` tab, we'll open the `users` table and click `Relationships`. Choose, `Add a remote schema relationship`
and name it `emoji` and choose our `countries` Remote Schema.

Then, we'll check the boxes for `countries`, `filter`, `code`, and `eq`. We'll choose to connect these fields via the
`country` column on the `users` table.

Now, if you run the following query, you should get a response that includes all of your users along with their
country's emoji flag:

```graphql
query GetUsers {
  users {
    id
    name
    country
    emoji {
      emoji
    }
  }
}
```

  </div>
</details>

### Step 9. Execute logic on a schedule

Typical of most applications, we'll need to execute certain tasks on a schedule. For example, we may want to send users
a summary of their incomplete tasks - from the previous day - every day at 9am. With Hasura, you can do this with
[**Scheduled Triggers**](/scheduled-triggers/overview.mdx). This allows you to hit an endpoint on a schedule and execute
any logic you wish. As with Actions and Event Triggers, you can point these Scheduled Triggers at endpoints that you
host anywhere.

<Player src="/img/resources/use-case/gql-backend/sched-triggers.webm" />

<details>
  <summary>Show me how to do this</summary>
  <div>

We'll simulate this example using httpbin. We'll create a Scheduled Trigger that will hit an endpoint every minute and
return a message that says, "You have incomplete tasks!" We'll set the cron schedule to `* * * * *` so you can see this
in action. Though, in production, you'll want to set this to `0 9 * * *` so it runs every day at 9am.

Simply name the trigger `notify_incomplete_tasks` and enter the following endpoint:

```bash
http://httpbin.org/post
```

Then, add a payload:

```json
{
  "message": "You have incomplete tasks!"
}
```

Now that we've created the Scheduled Trigger, we can test it out. If you head to the `Events` tab, you should see a log
of the event that was scheduled.

### Step 10. Stream your data in real-time

One of the greatest benefits of GraphQL is that it allows you to stream data in real-time. With Hasura, you can do this
with [**Subscriptions**](/subscriptions/overview.mdx). This allows you to subscribe to changes in your database and
receive updates in real-time. For example, as an admin, you may want to see a list of all currently logged-in users. You
can create a subscription that will return a list of all users that are currently logged-in and that will update in
real-time as users log in and out.

<Player src="/img/resources/use-case/gql-backend/subs.webm" />

<details>
  <summary>Show me how to do this</summary>
  <div>

Subscriptions work out of the box with Hasura. All you need to do is subscribe to the changes you want to receive. In
the example below, we'll subscribe to changes in the `users` table. Write this subscription in the GraphiQL Explorer and
hit run:

```graphql
subscription MySubscription {
  users(where: { is_online: { _eq: true } }) {
    id
    is_online
    name
  }
}
```

Then, execute the following mutation - with your endpoint and secret values added - via a curl request:

```bash
curl --location --request POST '<YOUR_PROJECT_ENDPOINT>' --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --header 'x-hasura-admin-secret: <YOUR_PROJECT_SECRET>' --data-raw '{"variables": {"id": 1, "is_online": true}, "query": "mutation MyMutation($id: Int!, $is_online: Boolean!) { update_users_by_pk(pk_columns: {id: $id}, _set: {is_online: $is_online}) { id name is_online }}" }'
```
