Quickstart with Heroku
======================

This guide will help you get Hasura GraphQL engine and Postgres running on `Heroku's free tier <https://www.heroku.com/free>`_.
It is the easiest and fastest way of trying Hasura out.

If you'd like to link this to an existing database, please head to this guide instead:
:doc:`Using an existing database on Heroku <../deployment/heroku/using-existing-heroku-database>`.
