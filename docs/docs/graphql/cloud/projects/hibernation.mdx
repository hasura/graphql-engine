# Project Hibernation and Reactivation

## Introduction

As part of our regular maintenance cycle, projects on the free tier that haven't seen any API request activity for the past three months are hibernated after two notices to their owners. Here are some FAQs related to the process and reactivation:

## Frequently Asked Questions

### My Hasura Cloud project is hibernated. What does this mean?

All the metadata and project details are still preserved, but you won't be able to make any API calls to the instance endpoint. However, if you want to keep using your project, you can reactivate it manually from your project's section to continue using Hasura seamlessly.

### How will I know when any of my projects will be hibernated?

After sixty days of inactivity, the project owner will receive the first email informing them about the hibernation of the project in 30 days. 

Fifteen days after that, at the 75-day mark, they will receive a reminder. 

Finally, another fifteen days later, they will receive a confirmation email informing that the project has been hibernated.

### How do I abort the hibernation process?

The hibernation process starts when your project is inactive for 60 days. If you make any GraphQL requests to your project's API you will be generating activity and aborting the process.

### How do I reactivate my hibernated project?

If you are the **project owner**, clicking on the `Reactivate` button of your project's section will allow you to reactivate the project.

If you are a **collaborator**, the project's section will ask you to contact the project owner to let them reactivate the project.
