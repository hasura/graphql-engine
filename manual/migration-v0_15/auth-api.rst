Auth API changes
================

The Auth microservice has been completely re-written with a new internal
architecture. The new version of Hasura Auth is available from Hasura v0.15.
This was done so that custom authentication methods can be plugged-in very
easily.

As a result, the user facing APIs and the configuration settings has changed
completely.

Please look at the current Auth documentation to see what has changed.
