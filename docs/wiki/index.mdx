# Hasura Docs Wiki

Welcome to the Hasura Docs Wiki! We're glad you're here and are excited to see your docs contributions. They're going to
be great ðŸ™Œ

On the following pages, you'll find all the information you need to get started. A perfect place to begin would be the
[Contributing to Docs](/contributions.mdx) page that will walk you through the end-to-end contribution process from
setting up your local development environment to creating your first PR.

## What is good documentation?

Good documentation uses clear, simple, effective communication to explain the usage and workings of our product as
completely as possible.

Documentation is critically important. It's our most visited web property besides the homepage and without good,
thorough documentation, users can not use, or enjoy using our product.

:::warning The Rule

If a product feature doesnâ€™t have excellent feature and reference documentation then it is not a finished feature.

:::

Good documentation is vital to the health of our company and brand. Users often discover new features or upgrade based
on information they find in documentation.

Every Hasurian is responsible for creating and continually improving the documentation.

Your task is to create rich, correct documentation content which fully covers the feature being referenced in a
user-obsessed, complete and compelling way.

## Types of documentation

We strive to create quality, rich content in four logical areas of documentation including:

- Explanation
- Task guides
- Tutorials
- Reference

It is your task to consider which of these types of documentation fits the user requirement most for the feature you
are documenting it. Maybe it's two or three, maybe it's all of them

### Explanation

Explanation documentation details and clarifies a particular topic, providing deep insight into the workings of a
feature of Hasura delivered in a long-form format.

### Task guides

Task guides complement explanation sections by providing information about how to accomplish specific isolated tasks
step-by-step.

### Tutorials

Tutorials teach the creation of a larger system based on generalized use-case scenarios. These are generally longer and
more involved than task guides and cover the end-to-end creation and setup of a system.

### Reference

Reference guides, such as those for the Hasura API, exhaustively cover all possible usages, definitions and edge cases
of a feature in a succinct, look-up type format.

## The docs contribution process

We have a full write-up on the wiki about the
[docs contribution process](/contributions.mdx##step-1-create-a-new-branch), please check it out.

Importantly, the docs team is tasked with maintaining and uplifting the quality of the documentation with every
single pull request. Please also check out the [docs PR checklist](/checklist.mdx) with info about how you can
ensure the quality of your docs PR.

## Measurement & feedback

The impact of all documentation whether new, changed or existing should be measured with analytics and user feedback
tools over time to determine its quality and impact for our user audience.

## Next steps...

After your local environment is set up, feel free to poke around the style guide, explanation of our page structures,
and info on working with Docusaurus (our docs framework).
