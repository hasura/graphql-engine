# Connecting Hasura to a Timescale Postgres Database

## Introduction

This guide explains how to connect a new or existing [Timescale Postgres](https://www.timescale.com/) database to a
Hasura instance, either on [Hasura Cloud](https://cloud.hasura.io) or via one of our
[self-hosted](/deployment/deployment-guides/index.mdx) solutions. If you're exploring Timescale Postgres and are interested in
migrating an existing Postgres database - such as from Heroku - check out their
[docs](https://docs.timescale.com/timescaledb/latest/how-to-guides/migrate-data/) before continuing below.

:::info Note

If you plan on using Hasura Cloud, which we recommend, follow steps 1 and 2 below. If you're self-hosting a Hasura instance and
already have a project running, skip to [step 3](#create-pg-db-timescale).

:::

## Step 1: Sign up or log in to Hasura Cloud

Navigate to [Hasura Cloud](https://cloud.hasura.io/signup/?pg=docs&plcmt=body&cta=navigate-to-hasura-cloud&tech=default)
and sign up or log in.

## Step 2: Create a Hasura Cloud project {#create-hasura-project-timescale}

On the Hasura Cloud dashboard, create a new project:

<Thumbnail src="/img/cloud-dbs/create-hasura-cloud-project.png" alt="Create Hasura Cloud project" width="1000px" />

You will get prompted for a Postgres Database URL. We will create this in the next step and then come back here.

After the project is initialized successfully, click on `Launch Console` to open the Hasura Console in your browser.

On the Hasura Console, navigate to `Data -> Manage -> Connect Database -> Connect existing database`:

## Step 3: Create a Postgres DB on Timescale Cloud {#create-pg-db-timescale}

Log into the [Timescale Cloud portal](https://portal.timescale.cloud/login).

On the Timescale dashboard, under `Services`, click on `+ Create new service`:

<Thumbnail

  alt="Create a new service on Timescale"
  width="1000px"
/>

Select the Postgres option:

<Thumbnail src="/img/cloud-dbs/timescale/select-postgres.png" alt="Select Postgres on Timescale" width="700px" />

Scroll down and select the `Cloud Provider`, `Region` and `Service Plan` based on your requirements.

In the end, enter a `Name` for the service:

<Thumbnail src="/img/cloud-dbs/timescale/create-service.png" alt="Create a service on Timescale" width="1000px" />

Then click `Create service`.

:::info Note

If you're using a database user other than the default one, make sure to give it the right
[Postgres permissions](/deployment/postgres-requirements.mdx#managed-pg-permissions).

:::

## Step 4: Allow connections to your DB from Hasura

On the `Services` dashboard, click on your DB:

<Thumbnail src="/img/cloud-dbs/timescale/select-db.png" alt="Select DB on Timescale" width="1000px" />

Scroll down to `Allowed IP Addresses` and click on `Change`:

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/cloud-dbs/timescale/change-allowed-ip-addresses.png"
  alt="Change allowed IP addresses on Timescale"
  width="1000px"
/>

If using Hasura Cloud, from your project's dashboard, copy the Hasura Cloud IP address:

<Thumbnail src="/img/projects/hasura-cloud-ip.png" alt="Hasura Cloud IP field" width="1000px" />

:::info Note

If you're using a self-hosted solution, you'll need to determine the IP address manually depending on your hosting
service.

:::

Add the Hasura IP address that you copied, click on the `+` and then click on `Save changes`:

<Thumbnail src="/img/cloud-dbs/timescale/add-hasura-ip.png" alt="Add the Hasura IP on Timescale" width="500px" />

## Step 5: Get the database connection URL {#get-db-url-timescale}

The structure of the database connection URL looks as follows:

```bash
postgresql://<user-name>:<password>@<public-ip>:<postgres-port>/<db>?sslmode=require
```

To get it, navigate to the `Overview` tab of your database dashboard and copy the `Service URI`:

<Thumbnail src="/img/cloud-dbs/timescale/copy-service-uri.png" alt="Copy the service URI on Timescale" width="1000px" />

## Step 6: Finish connecting the database

Back on the Hasura Console, enter the database URL that we retrieved in [step 5](#get-db-url-timescale):

<Thumbnail src="/img/cloud-dbs/timescale/TS-complete.png" alt="Database setup" width="600px" />

Then click `Connect Database`.

:::info Note

For security reasons, it is recommended to set database URLs as [env vars](/hasura-cloud/projects/env-vars.mdx) and using the env
vars to connect to the databases in place of the raw database URLs.

:::

Voil√†. You are ready to start developing.

## Next steps

- You can check out our [30-Minute Hasura Basics Course](https://hasura.io/learn/graphql/hasura/introduction/) and other
  [GraphQL & Hasura Courses](https://hasura.io/learn/) for a more detailed introduction to Hasura.

- If using Hasura Cloud, you can also click the gear icon to manage your Hasura Cloud project. (e.g. add
  [collaborators](/hasura-cloud/projects/collaborators.mdx), [env vars](/hasura-cloud/projects/env-vars.mdx) or
  [custom domains](/hasura-cloud/projects/domains.mdx)).
