# Maintenance mode

## Introduction

When updates are being rolled out to your Hasura Cloud project which
demand no interruptions to your instance's configuration, maintenance
mode is activated for your project.

:::info Note

Currently, cloud maintenance mode will only be activated for your
project while you are updating it to Hasura GraphQL Engine `v2.0`.

:::

:::info Note

This is not to be confused with environment variable
`HASURA_GRAPHQL_ENABLE_MAINTENANCE_MODE`. The two are different as the
env var enables the server maintenance mode which disables metadata APIs
(writes) on the project while the cloud maintenance mode does not. See
below for actions disabled by the cloud maintenance mode.

:::

## Check if maintenance mode is activated

Navigate to your project's settings page, you should see a top banner
mentioning if your project is under maintenance.

  alt="Project with maintenance mode activated"
/>

If you don't see such a banner, your project is not under maintenance
mode.

## Disabled actions when maintenance mode is activated

All actions that update your project's configurations are not allowed
when maintenance mode is activated. The following actions are
disallowed:

-  [Switching pricing plans](/graphql/cloud/projects/pricing.mdx)
-  [Adding, updating and deleting an environment variable](/graphql/cloud/projects/env-vars.mdx)
-  [Changing project region](/graphql/cloud/projects/regions.mdx)
-  [Enabling and disabling Heroku database URL sync](/graphql/cloud/projects/heroku-url-sync.mdx)
-  [Deleting project](/graphql/cloud/projects/delete.mdx)

If you are trying to apply these changes when maintenance mode is
activated, you will encounter an error.
