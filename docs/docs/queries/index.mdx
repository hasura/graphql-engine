# Queries

## Introduction

GraphQL queries are used to fetch data from the server.

Hasura GraphQL engine auto-generates queries as part of the GraphQL schema from your database's schema model. It
generates a range of possible queries and operators that also work with relationships defined in your SQL schema.

All tables of the database tracked by the GraphQL engine can be queried over the GraphQL endpoint. If you have a tracked
table in your database, its query field is added as a nested field under the `query_root` root level type.

## Authentication

For information about authenticating your queries see the [authentication section](/auth/authentication/index.mdx) here.
