# Subscriptions

## Introduction

A GraphQL subscription is essentially a query where the client receives an update whenever the value of any field
changes upstream.

Subscriptions are supported for all kinds of queries. All the concepts of [queries](/queries/index.mdx) hold true for
subscriptions as well.

:::info Caveat

Hasura follows the [GraphQL spec](https://graphql.github.io/graphql-spec/June2018/#sec-Single-root-field) which allows
for only one root field in a subscription.
