# Inherited roles

## Introduction

An inherited role is a way to create a new role which inherits
permissions from two or more roles.

Once an inherited role is created, it can be treated as any other role
i.e. can be given in `X-Hasura-Role` session variable.

Inherited roles are useful when you need to define multiple permission
rules (may be overlapping) on schema objects and also for greater
modularity in role management.

By default, inherited roles will try to inherit the permissions from its
parent roles. If you'd rather like to have a different permission than
the inherited one for a particular entity and role pair, then it can be
done by creating a permission for the entity and role pair. After
creating this permission, it will override the inherited permission, if
any.

:::tip Supported from

Inherited roles are supported for versions `v2.0.0-alpha.4` and above.
The inherited roles feature is an experimental feature from verions
`v2.0.0-alpha.4` till `v2.1.0-beta.1`, i.e it must be explicitly toggled
in order to be enabled. This can be done either by setting the env var
`HASURA_GRAPHQL_EXPERIMENTAL_FEATURES` or the server flag
`--experimental-features` to `inherited_roles`.

For versions `v2.1.0-beta.1` and above, inherited roles are enabled by
default.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

To add a new inherited role, edit the `metadata/inherited_roles.yaml`
file adding the inherited role definition like this:

```yaml
- role_name: sample_inherited_role
  role_set:
    - user
    - editor
```

Apply the metadata by running:

```bash
hasura metadata apply
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="api" label="API">

You can add a inherited role using the
[add_inherited_role metadata API](/graphql/core/api-reference/metadata-api/inherited-roles.mdx#metadata-add-inherited-role):

```http
POST /v1/metadata HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
X-Hasura-Role: admin

{
  "type": "add_inherited_role",
  "args": {
     "role_name":"sample_inherited_role",
     "role_set":[
        "user",
        "editor"
     ]
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info Note

Inherited roles cannot form cycles.

**For example:**

Suppose there are two inherited roles: `inherited_role1`,
`inherited_role2` and two non-inherited roles: `role1`, `role2` and:

`inherited_role1` inherits from `role1` and `inherited_role2`
`inherited_role2` inherits from `role2` and `inherited_role1`

The above configuration won't work because `inherited_role1` and
`inherited_role2` form a cycle.

## How is the permission of the inherited role inherited?

### 1. Select permissions

A select permission is comprised of the following things:

1. Columns accessible to the role
2. Row selection filter
3. Limit
4. Allow aggregation
5. Scalar computed fields accessible to the role

Suppose there are two roles, `role1` gives access to column `C1` with
row filter `P1` and `role2` gives access to columns `C1` and `C2` with
row filter `P2`. Consider the following GraphQL query executed with an
inherited role comprised of `role1` and `role2`:

```graphql
query {
  T {
    C1
    C2
  }
}
```

The above GraphQL query will be translated to the following SQL query.

```sql
select (case when (P1 or P2) then C1 else null end) as C1,
       (case when P2 then C2 else null end) as C2
from T
where (P1 or P2)
```

The other parameters of the select permission will be combined in the
following manner:

1. Limit - Maximum of the limits will be the limit of the inherited
   role
2. Allow aggregations - If any of the role allows aggregation, then the
   inherited role will allow aggregation
3. Scalar computed fields - same as table column fields, as in the
   above example

#### Accessibility of a field for an inherited role

Accessibility of a field for an inherited role is defined as follows:

1. When all the roles give access to a column `C`, then `C` will always
   be accessible.
2. When not all, but some of the roles give access to the column `C`
   then the value of the column `C` will be outputed when the OR of
   `P1,P2....P(n)` is `true` and when it evaluates to `false`, the
   value of the column `C` will be `null`, where `P` is the row filter
   of the select permissions in which column `C` is given access to.
3. When none of the roles give access to column `C`, it won't be
   accessible to the inherited role.

#### Examples

Let's take the example of an `users` table with the following columns:

1. `id` - Int - Primary key
2. `name` - Text
3. `email` - Text

There are two roles defined namely `employee` and `manager`.

1. User role - The user role will be able to access all columns of
   their row when the session variable `X-Hasura-User-Id` is equal to
   the `id`.
2. Anonymous role - The anonymous role will be able to access only the
   `id` and `name` columns of all the users.

Let's create a new inherited role called `user_anonymous_inherited_role`
which inherits from the `user` and the `anonymous` roles.

1.  Executing the query as `user` role

```http
POST /v1/graphql HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
X-Hasura-Role: user
X-Hasura-User-Id: 1
```

<GraphiQLIDE
  query={`query {
  users {
    id
    name
    email
  }
 }`}
  response={`{
  "data": {
    "users": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "alice",
        "email": "alice@xyz.com"
      }
    ]
    }
 }`}
/>

2.  Executing the query as `anonymous` role

```http
POST /v1/graphql HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
X-Hasura-Role: anonymous
```

<GraphiQLIDE
  query={`query {
  users {
    id
    name
  }
 }`}
  response={`{
  "data": {
    "users": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Alice"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "name": "Bob"
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "name": "Sam"
    }
    ]
  }
 }`}
/>

3.  Executing the query as `user_anonymous_inherited_role` role

```http
POST /v1/graphql HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
X-Hasura-Role: user_anonymous_inherited_role
X-Hasura-User-Id: 1
```

<GraphiQLIDE
  query={`query {
  users {
    id
    name
    email
  }
 }`}
  response={`{
  "data": {
    "users": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Alice",
      "email": "alice@xyz.com"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "name": "Bob",
      "email": null
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "name": "Sam",
      "email": null
    }
    ]
  }
 }`}
/>

In the response of the query being executed with the
`user_anonymous_inherited_role` role, there are 3 rows returned and
if we compare that to the queries executed as the `user` and
`anonymous` roles, the results are unioned in the inherited role.
But some of the fields have `null` values despite the value in the
database not being `null`. This can only happen with inherited roles
when a column doesn't have permission in the particular row. In the
above example, we see that the `email` of "Bob" and "Sam" is `null`
but a non null value for "Alice", this is because the "Alice" row is
executed as the `user` role and the other rows are executed as the
`anonymous` role which is why the value is `null`.

4. Suppose we have two tables `users` and `authors` and similarly two
   roles `user` and `author` are defined. The `user` role doesn't have
   permission to query the `authors` table and the `author` role
   doesn't have permission to query the `users` table. With only the
   `user` and the `author` role, we won't be able to construct a query
   which fetches data from both the tables. This can be solved by
   creating an inherited role out of `user` and `author` which can
   query both the tables in a single query.

```http
POST /v1/graphql HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
X-Hasura-Role: user_authors_inherited_role
X-Hasura-User-Id: 1
```

<GraphiQLIDE
  query={`query {
  users {
    id
    name
    email
  }
  authors {
    id
    name
    followers
  }
 }`}
  response={`{
  "data": {
    "users": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Alice",
      "email": "alice@xyz.com"
    }
    ],
    "authors": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Paulo Coelho",
      "followers": 10382193
    }
    ]
  }
 }`}
/>

### 2. Mutation and Remote Schema permissions

A mutation (insert, update and delete) or remote schema permission is
inherited in the following manner:

Suppose there's an inherited role `(R)` which inherits permissions from
`n` parent roles namely `pr1`, `pr2`, `pr3` ... `prn`. The permission
for the role `R` on some entity can only be inherited when the
permission on the entity is the same for all its parent roles.

For example, if two insert permissions are configured in the following
way:

1. insert permission of role `pr1`

   ```json
   {
     "type": "pg_create_insert_permission",
     "args": {
       "table": "article",
       "source": "default",
       "role": "pr1",
       "permission": {
         "check": {
           "author_id": "X-HASURA-AUTHOR-ID"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. insert permission of the role `pr2`

   ```json
   {
     "type": "pg_create_insert_permission",
     "args": {
       "table": "article",
       "source": "default",
       "role": "pr2",
       "permission": {
         "check": {
           "author_id": "X-HASURA-USER-ID"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

The `check` constraint is different in both the permissions and there's
no way to resolve this conflict.

Whenever a conflict occurs while a role inherits from its parents, then
the metadata for that entity and role combination will be marked as
inconsistent. These can be seen by calling the
[get_inconsistent_metadata](/graphql/core/api-reference/metadata-api/manage-metadata.mdx#metadata-get-inconsistent-metadata) API.
Following the above example, the role `R` which is trying to inherit
permissions from the role `pr1` and `pr2` will be marked as inconsistent
for the table permission of the table `article`.

This inconsistency is informational and can be ignored if the
conflicting role entity pair is not going to be used. If this
inconsistency needs to be resolved, then it can be done by adding a
permission explicitly for the conflicting role entity pair.

### 3. Actions and Custom Functions permissions

Inheritance of permissions of actions and custom functions work in the
following manner:

If any of the parent roles have permission configured for a given action
or custom function, then the inherited role will also be able to access
the given action or custom function.
