Setting up a GraphQL schema using an existing database

Introduction
------------

When you have an existing database with a schema already present, you don't need to create tables or views or run
DDL queries through the Hasura console.

All you need to do is indicate to Hasura GraphQL engine which tables and views you want to expose over GraphQL and
how they are connected to each other so that you can query them as a "graph".

Step 1: Track tables/views
--------------------------

Tracking a table or a view means telling Hasura GraphQL engine that you want to expose that table/view over GraphQL.

To track a table or a view:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Head to the ``Data -> Schema`` section of the console.
#. Under the heading ``Untracked Tables/Views``, click on the ``Track`` button next to the table/view name.

To track all tables and views present in the database:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Head to the ``Data -> Schema`` section of the console.
#. Under the heading ``Untracked Tables/Views``, click the ``Track All`` button.

Step 2: Track foreign-keys
--------------------------

Tracking a foreign-key means creating a :ref:`relationship <table_relationships>` between the tables involved in the
foreign-key.

To track a foreign-key between two tables in the database:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Head to the ``Data -> Schema`` section of the console.
#. Click on a table involved in the foreign-key and head to the ``Relationships`` tab.
#. You should see a suggested relationship based on the foreign-key. Click ``Add``, give a name to your relationship
   (this will be the name of the :ref:`nested object <nested_object_queries>` in the GraphQL query), and
   hit ``Save`` to create the relationship.
#. Repeat with the other table involved in the foreign-key.


To track all the foreign-keys of all tables in the database:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Head to the ``Data -> Schema`` section of the console.
#. Under the heading ``Untracked foreign-key relations``, click the ``Track All`` button to automatically
   create relationships based on the foreign-keys.

.. admonition:: Relationship nomenclature

  In this case, Hasura GraphQL engine will **automatically generate relationship names** (the names of the
  :ref:`nested objects <nested_object_queries>` in the GraphQL query) based on the table names and the
  foreign-key names.

  The name is generated in the following format:

  - For object relationships: ``singular of foreignTableName``
  - For array relationships: ``plural of foreignTableName``

  For example, for the foreign-key ``article.author_id -> author.id``, the relationship names will be
  ``author`` for ``article`` table and ``articles`` for ``author`` table.

  In case a field with the generated name already exists, a new name will be generated of the form:
  ``camel case of (singular/plural of foreignTableName + _by_ + foreignKeyColumnName)``

  Note that, **this is just  an arbitrary naming convention** chosen by Hasura to ensure the generation of unique
  relationship names. You can choose to rename your relationships to anything you wish. You can **change the
  relationship names** with a name of your choice as shown in :ref:`rename_relationships`.
