  -- which is not what we originally wanted. But building the test modules

  -- By default GHC is dynamically linked, so to run TemplateHaskell you need dynamic versions of
  -- libraries. But, also by default, cabal links executables statically, which requires static
  -- versions of the libraries. Therefore, by default, cabal builds with -dynamic-too to generate
  -- static and dynamic versions of all object files.
  -- Setting executable-dynamic: True forces cabal to build a dynamic executable; but it's not
  -- enough on its own: since library-vanilla defaults to True, cabal would still build a static
  -- library. With those two flags together, we can finally only build one version of the library,
  -- which substentially improves compilation time.
