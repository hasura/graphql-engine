To try Hasura with SQL Server, you'll need your own new or existing SQL Server database.

Here are 2 ways you can get started with Hasura and SQL Server:

1.  [Hasura Cloud](/databases/ms-sql-server/getting-started/cloud.mdx): You'll need to be able to access your SQL Server
    database from Hasura Cloud.
2.  [Docker](/databases/ms-sql-server/getting-started/docker.mdx): Run Hasura with Docker and then connect your SQL
    Server database to Hasura.

## Supported features

Hasura currently supports queries, subscriptions, mutations, relationships, permissions, and Event Triggers on MS SQL
Server.
