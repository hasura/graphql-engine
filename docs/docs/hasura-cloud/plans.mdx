# Plans and Pricing

<div className="badge badge--primary heading-badge">Available on: Cloud</div>

## Overview

[Hasura Cloud](https://cloud.hasura.io) offers three plans: Hasura Cloud Free, Hasura Cloud Professional, and Hasura
Cloud Enterprise.

Hasura Cloud billing is based on the consumption of resources. For paid plans, you can either pay as you go monthly in
arrears or make an annual commitment with an upfront payment for the usage. Below, you'll find an overview of each plan
and details on how we calculate billing. Check out our [pricing FAQ](https://hasura.io/pricing#faq) for common
questions.

## Hasura Cloud Plans

### Hasura Cloud Free

The Hasura Cloud Free plan is - as it's named - free to use. You can create up to **three** Projects under the plan to
try out the Hasura fully-managed GraphQL APIs.

Each Project can use up to **two data connectors** with **100 MB of data passthrough per month**, and up to **1 million
API requests per month**. You can get higher entitlements after upgrading to the Hasura Cloud Professional plan.

### Hasura Cloud Professional

Hasura Cloud Professional is a pay-as-you-go monthly subscription plan. You only pay for your consumption every month.
We calculate billing, using the following categories, per Project:

- Types of databases connected to the Project
- Data passthrough

Hasura Cloud Professional is billed for the number of hours each Project runs and the amount of data passthrough. The
price depends on the type(s) of database(s) connected to the Project. If a Project uses a generic Postgres database and
a premium database, **you are only billed for the premium database at $3.00 /hr**.

| Database Type      | Rate     |
| ------------------ | -------- |
| Generic Postgres   | $1.50/hr |
| Snowflake          | $3.00/hr |
| BigQuery           | $3.00/hr |
| Athena             | $3.00/hr |
| MSSQL              | $3.00/hr |
| CockroachDB        | $3.00/hr |
| Google AlloyDB     | $3.00/hr |
| Citus / Hyperscale | $3.00/hr |

:::info Projects without databases

A Project without a connected database is billed at $1.50/hr.

#### Data passthrough

Hasura Cloud meters data passing through it to external services, including request data that is sent to upstream
services (e.g., databases) and response data sent to downstream services (e.g., web apps) at a rate of $0.13/GB.

You will be billed based on this volume of data that passes through Hasura every month.

#### Example Calculation

Assuming thirty days in the month, you start with one Project with a Postgres data connector for the first twenty-one
days of the Project:

`21 days * 24 hrs/day * $1.50/hr = $756`

On the twenty-second day, you decide to add the Snowflake data connector and leave it connected until the end of the
month:

`9 days * 24hrs/day * $3.00/hr = $648`

Let's assume the data passthrough for the entire month is 1000 GB:

`1000 GB * $0.13/GB = $130 Total`

The total cost for the month is $1534.

### Hasura Cloud Enterprise

The Hasura Cloud Enterprise plan offers the ability to commit to a minimum spending amount over a minimum 12-month
commitment period. You can view the total amount of accrued usage during the commitment term and the amount of committed
spending left in your account. You can renew your commitment if your commitment is depleted before the expiry of the
commitment period.
