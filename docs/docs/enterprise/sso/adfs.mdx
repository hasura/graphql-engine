# Console SSO with Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS)

<div className="badge badge--primary heading-badge">Available on: Self-hosted Enterprise</div>

## Overview

SSO can be configured with ADFS SAML by setting up [Dex](https://dexidp.io/docs/) as an OAuth2 proxy. Access can be
configured for all users of a domain or only for members of certain groups.

This guide assumes you have a Hasura GraphQL Engine instance running with a valid license key. If you don't have one,
you can get a license key via a [30-day free trial](/enterprise/try-hasura-enterprise-edition.mdx) or by contacting the
[Hasura team](mailto:sales@hasura.io).

:::info Supported from

SSO for ADFS is supported from versions `v2.25.0` and above.

:::

## Step 1: Configure ADFS

We assume that you have deployed the
[ADFS service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/deployment/ad-fs-deployment-guide). To
configure SAML for ADFS, you need to create a
[Relying party trust](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/operations/create-a-relying-party-trust)
and make sure that:

- The `Enable support for the SAML 2.0 WebSSO protocol` checkbox is checked.
- The Dex callback URL is entered in the `Relying party SAML 2.0 SSO service URL` textbox.

  <Thumbnail
    src="/img/enterprise/sso-adfs-trust-party-url.png"
    alt="Relying party SAML 2.0 SSO service URL"
    width="600px"
  />

- On the `Configure Identifiers page`, add a `Relying party trust identifier`

:::info You'll need this later

You'll need the `Relying party trust identifier` to configure Dex's `entityIssuer`. Note this value.

:::

### Add Claims

After creating the Relying Party Trust, select the `Relying Party Trusts` folder from AD FS Management, and choose
`Edit Claim Rules` from the Actions sidebar to add claims.

- To pass attributes of a user from LDAP, create a rule with the `Send LDAP Attributes as Claims` as a template.
- Choose `Active Directory` as your Attribute Store.
- Map your LDAP attributes to ongoing claim types. Dex only requires the `username`, `mail`, and role-equivalent fields.

  <Thumbnail src="/img/enterprise/sso-adfs-add-claims.png" alt="Add claims for SSO ADFS" width="600px" />

- Click on the `View Rule Language` button to get the attribute name. These were the attribute names that were mapped in
  the previous step.

  <Thumbnail src="/img/enterprise/sso-adfs-view-rule.png" alt="View XML attribute names" width="600px" />

- Click `Finish` and `Apply` the change in the `Edit Claim Issuance Policy` window.

### Export Signing Certificate

Finally, you'll need to export the signing certificate from the ADFS console to mount it to Dex.

<Thumbnail src="/img/enterprise/sso-adfs-certificates.png" alt="ADFS SSO Certificates" width="600px" />

1. Go to `ADFS > Service > Certificates`. Select the `Token-signing` certificate, and right-click to select
   `View Certificate`.
2. On the `Details tab`, click `Copy to File...`. This launches the Certificate Export Wizard. Click `Next`.
3. Choose `Base-64 encoded X.509 (.CER)` as the format you'd like to use. Click Next.
4. Download to the location where Dex is deployed.

## Step 2: Configure Hasura

The table below describes the configuration options for ADFS SSO. Hasura GraphQL Engine will expect these values to be
set as the value of the
[`HASURA_GRAPHQL_SSO_PROVIDERS`](/deployment/graphql-engine-flags/reference.mdx/#single-sign-on-providers) environment
variable:

| Key                     | Example                                                                                             | Description                                                                                                                            |

Using the information above as an example, you can configure the `HASURA_GRAPHQL_SSO_PROVIDERS` environment variable as
follows:

```json
[
  {
    "client_id": "dex-login",
    "admin_roles": ["admin"],
    "name": "Dex Login",
    "authorization_url": "http://localhost:5556/dex/auth",
    "request_token_url": "http://localhost:5556/dex/token",
    "scope": "openid offline_access groups",
    "jwt_secret": {
      "type": "RS256",
      "jwk_url": "http://localhost:5556/dex/keys",
      "issuer": "http://localhost:5556:5556/dex",
      "claims_map": {
        "x-hasura-allowed-roles": {
          "path": "$.groups"
        },
        "x-hasura-default-role": {
          "path": "$.groups[0]"
        }
      }
    }
  }
]
```

:::info Setting environment variables

For guidance on setting environment variables or flags for Hasura GraphQL Engine, see
[server configuration](/deployment/graphql-engine-flags/index.mdx).

:::

## Step 3: Configure Dex

Your Dex configuration will need the following fields set to enable ADFS SAML SSO. You can find a sample configuration
file below. This file should be saved in the `/dex` directory of your container.

### Issuer

The base path of Dex and the external name of the OpenID Connect service. This is the canonical URL that all clients
**must** use to refer to Dex. If a path is provided, Dex's HTTP service will listen at a non-root URL. This is the
public URL at which Dex is available.

Example:

```plaintext
http://dex-domain:5556/dex
```

### Static clients

This contains the `id` and `redirectURIs`. The `id` will reference the `client_id` in the Hasura configuration. The
`redirectURIs` will be the oauth callback URL of Hasura Console, which is at
`http(s)://<hasura-endpoint>/console/oauth2/callback`.

Example:

```yaml
staticClients:
  - id: dex-login
    redirectURIs:
      - 'http://localhost:8080/console/oauth2/callback'
    name: 'Dex Login'
    public: true
```

### Connectors

The connectors field is an array of objects that define the various connectors being used in the Dex configuration. Each
object in the array contains a type field that specifies the type of connector being used. Here, we'll use `type: saml`
along with a series of fields that are specific to the SAML connector.

```yaml
connectors:
  - type: saml
    id: saml-auth0
    name: Auth0 SAML
    config:
      ssoURL: https://sts.example.local/adfs/ls/
      ca: /etc/dex/saml-ca.pem
      # insecureSkipSignatureValidation: true
      redirectURI: http://localhost:5556/dex/callback
      usernameAttr: http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/name
      emailAttr: http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/emailaddress
      groupsAttr: http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/role
      entityIssuer: https://sts.example.local/adfs/ls/
```

      entityIssuer: https://sts.example.local/adfs/ls/
```

## Step 4: Update your deployment

Finally, you'll need to configure your deployment with these changes. Here is a Docker Compose example, with the
configuration:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:15
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    ports:
      - '5432'
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgrespassword

  hasura-pro:
    image: hasura/graphql-engine:v2.25.0
    ports:
      - '8080:8080'
    depends_on:
      - postgres
    restart: always
    environment:
      HASURA_GRAPHQL_EE_LICENSE_KEY: <YOUR_EE_LICENSE_KEY>
      HASURA_GRAPHQL_ADMIN_SECRET: <YOUR_ADMIN_SECRET>
      HASURA_GRAPHQL_DATABASE_URL: postgres://postgres:postgrespassword@postgres:5432/postgres?sslmode=disable
      HASURA_GRAPHQL_ENABLE_CONSOLE: 'true'
      HASURA_GRAPHQL_DEV_MODE: 'true'
      HASURA_GRAPHQL_ENABLED_LOG_TYPES: startup,http-log,webhook-log,websocket-log,query-log
      HASURA_GRAPHQL_ENABLED_APIS: metadata,graphql,config,metrics
      HASURA_GRAPHQL_METRICS_SECRET: <YOUR_METRICS_SECRET>
      HASURA_GRAPHQL_CONSOLE_ASSETS_DIR: /srv/console-assets
      HASURA_GRAPHQL_SSO_PROVIDERS:
        '[{"client_id": "dex-login","admin_roles": ["hasura-admin@company.com"], "name": "Dex
        Login","authorization_url": "http://127.0.0.1:5556/dex/auth","request_token_url":
        "http://127.0.0.1:5556/dex/token","scope": "openid offline_access groups","jwt_secret": {"type":
        "RS256","jwk_url": "http://dex:5556/dex/keys","issuer": "http://127.0.0.1:5556/dex","claims_map":
        {"x-hasura-allowed-roles": { "path": "$.groups" },"x-hasura-default-role": { "path": "$.groups[0]" }}}}]'

  dex:
    image: dexidp/dex
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - ./dex/config.docker.yaml:/etc/dex/config.docker.yaml
      - ./dex/adfs-saml.cer:/dex/adfs-saml.cer
    ports:
      - '5556:5556'

volumes:
  postgres_data:
```

## Step 5: Log in

At this point, you should see a `Dex Login` option on the Hasura Console. Now, you're ready to log in with your ADFS
account 🎉
