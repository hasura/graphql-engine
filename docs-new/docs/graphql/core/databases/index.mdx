# Databases

## Introduction

The Hasura GraphQL engine automatically generates your GraphQL schema
and resolvers based on tables/views in your database . **You don't need
to write a GraphQL schema or resolvers.** See
[How Hasura GraphQL engine works](/graphql/core/how-it-works/index.mdx) for more details.

The Hasura console gives you UI tools that speed up your data-modelling
process, or working with your existing databases. The console also
automatically generates migrations or metadata files that you can edit
directly and check into your version control.

- [Postgres](/graphql/core/databases/postgres/index.mdx)
