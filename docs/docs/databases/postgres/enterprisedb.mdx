# Connecting Hasura to an EnterpriseDB (BigAnimal) Postgres Database

## Introduction

This guide explains how to connect a new or existing
[EnterpriseDB](https://www.enterprisedb.com/products/biganimal-cloud-postgresql) (BigAnimal) Postgres database to a
Hasura instance, either on [Hasura Cloud](https://cloud.hasura.io?skip_onboarding=true) or
[self-hosted](/deployment/deployment-guides/index.mdx). If you're exploring EnterpriseDB Postgres and are interested in
migrating an existing Postgres database - such as from Heroku - check out their
[docs](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/biganimal/latest/migration/cold_migration/) before continuing below.

:::info Note

If you plan on using Hasura Cloud, which we recommend, follow steps 1 and 2 below. If you're self-hosting a Hasura
instance and already have a project running, skip to [step 3](#create-pg-db-enterprisedb).

:::

## Step 1: Sign up or log in to Hasura Cloud

Navigate to [Hasura Cloud](https://cloud.hasura.io/signup/?pg=docs&plcmt=body&cta=navigate-to-hasura-cloud&tech=default)
and sign up or log in.

## Step 2: Create a Hasura Cloud project {#create-hasura-project}

On the Hasura Cloud dashboard, create a new project:

<Thumbnail src="/img/cloud-dbs/create-hasura-cloud-project.png" alt="Create Hasura Cloud project" />

After the project is initialized successfully, click on `Launch Console` to open the Hasura Console in your browser.

On the Hasura Console, navigate to the `Data` tab and choose `Connect Existing Database`. Hasura will prompt you for a
Postgres Database URL. We'll create this in the next step and then come back here.

## Step 3: Create a BigAnimal Postgres DB on EnterpriseDB {#create-pg-db-enterprisedb}

Log into [EnterpriseDB](https://www.enterprisedb.com/dashboard) and head to your dashboard.

From your dashboard, scroll down and click `Test drive for free` in the BigAnimal section:

<Thumbnail src="/img/cloud-dbs/big-animal/big-animal-test-drive.png" alt="Test drive BigAnimal" width="700px" />

EnterpriseDB will create a free trial and redirect you to your BigAnimal portal. From this portal, click
`Create New Cluster`:

<Thumbnail src="/img/cloud-dbs/big-animal/big-animal-create-new-cluster.png" alt="Create new cluster" width="700px" />

Select the type of cluster and provider you plan to use, then click `Next: Cluster Settings`:

<Thumbnail

  alt="Choose type and provider"
  width="700px"
/>

Enter a cluster name and password:

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/cloud-dbs/big-animal/big-animal-cluster-name-password.png"
  alt="Add name and password"
  width="700px"
/>

Choose a database type, region, and instance type:

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/cloud-dbs/big-animal/big-animal-cluster-type-region.png"
  alt="Choose cluster type and region"
  width="700px"
/>

Select your storage and networking requirements, then click `Create Cluster`:

<Thumbnail

  alt="Choose storage and networking"
  width="700px"
/>

You'll be redirected to your BigAnimal portal and should see your cluster provisioning like this:

<Thumbnail src="/img/cloud-dbs/big-animal/big-animal-provisioning.png" alt="Cluster provisioning" width="700px" />

Congratulations! You've now created a BigAnimal Postgres instance on EnterpriseDB which you can use with Hasura GraphQL
Engine. Follow the steps below to connect it to Hasura.

## Step 4: Get the database connection parameters and finish connecting the database {#get-db-url}

The structure of the database connection URL looks as follows:

```bash
postgresql://<user-name>:<password>@<host-server>:<port>/<database-name>
```

BigAnimal doesn't provide an out-of-the-box connection string matching the format above. Instead, we'll use the
parameters from the `Connect` tab and pass them to Hasura.

After BigAnimal has provisioned the cluster, click on the title:

<Thumbnail src="/img/cloud-dbs/big-animal/big-animal-cluster-ready.png" alt="Cluster ready" width="700px" />

From the cluster's dashboard, choose the `Connect` tab:

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/cloud-dbs/big-animal/big-animal-connection-parameters.png"
  alt="Cluster connection parameters"
  width="700px"
/>

For each of the following under `Connection Info`, click `Copy` and paste their values into the appropriate fields on
the Hasura Console:

| BigAnimal parameter | Hasura parameter |
| ------------------- | ---------------- |
| Dbname              | Database Name    |
| Read/Write Host     | Host             |
| Port                | Port             |
| User                | Username         |

Back on the Hasura Console, paste your values into the mapped field:

<Thumbnail src="/img/cloud-dbs/big-animal/big-animal-connect-db.png" alt="Connect to Hasura Console" width="700px" />

:::info Note

BigAnimal doesn't present your password on the `Connect` tab. You'll need to provide the password you used to create the
cluster in Hasura's `Password` field.

:::

Then click `Connect Database`.

:::info Note

For security reasons, it is recommended to set database URLs as
[env vars](/hasura-cloud/projects/env-vars.mdx#manage-project-env-vars) and using the env vars to connect to the
databases in place of the raw database URLs.

:::

Voil√†. You are ready to start developing.

## Next steps

- You can check out our [30-Minute Hasura Basics Course](https://hasura.io/learn/graphql/hasura/introduction/) and other
  [GraphQL & Hasura Courses](https://hasura.io/learn/) for a more detailed introduction to Hasura.

- If using Hasura Cloud, you can also click the gear icon to manage your Hasura Cloud project. (e.g. add
  [collaborators](/hasura-cloud/projects/collaborators.mdx#manage-project-collaborators),
  [env vars](/hasura-cloud/projects/env-vars.mdx#manage-project-env-vars) or
  [custom domains](/hasura-cloud/projects/domains.mdx#manage-project-domains)).
