## Current status

A high-level overview of the current status of codebase in terms of tests

_Latest udpate: July 12th, 2022_

- [ ] We rely on `__tests__` directories but we should get rid of them because they add friction when we need to understand what has already been tested and what not
- [ ] We have to migrate the E2E tests (in progress)
