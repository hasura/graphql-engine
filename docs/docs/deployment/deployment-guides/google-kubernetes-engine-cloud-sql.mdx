# Hasura GraphQL engine on Google Cloud Platform with Kubernetes engine and Cloud SQL

## Introduction

This is a guide on deploying the Hasura GraphQL engine on the [Google
Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) using [Kubernetes
engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/) to run Hasura and
PosgreSQL backed by [Cloud SQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql/).

## Prerequisites

-   Google Cloud account with billing enabled (or a [free trial](https://cloud.google.com/free/))
-   `gcloud` CLI ([install](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/))
-   `kubectl` CLI ([install](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/))

The actions mentioned below can be done using the Google Cloud Console
and the `gcloud` CLI. But, for the sake of simplicity in documentation,
we are going to use `gcloud` CLI, so that commands can be easily
copy-pasted and executed.

Once the CLI is installed, initialize the SDK:

```bash
gcloud init
```

## Create a Google Cloud Project

A Google Cloud Project is used to group together resources. We'll create
a project called `hasura` for this guide.

```bash
gcloud projects create hasura
```

## Create a Google Cloud SQL Postgres instance

Create a Cloud SQL Postgres instance called `hasura-postgres` in the
`us-west2` region.

```bash
gcloud sql instances create hasura-postgres --database-version POSTGRES_9_6 \
       --cpu 1 --memory 3840MiB --region us-west2 --project hasura
```

Once the instance is created, set a password for the default `postgres`
user. Make sure you substitute `[PASSWORD]` with a strong password.

```bash
gcloud sql users set-password postgres --instance hasura-postgres \
       --password [PASSWORD] --project hasura
```

## Create a Kubernetes Cluster

Before creating the cluster, we need to enable the Kubernetes engine
API. Visit the below link in a browser to enable the API. Replace
`hasura` at the end of the URL with your project name, in case you're
not using the same name. Note that, you will need a billing account
added to the project to enable the API.

```bash
https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/container.googleapis.com/overview?project=hasura
```

Once the API is enabled, create a new Kubernetes cluster called
`hasura-k8s` in the `us-west2-a` zone with 1 node.

```bash
gcloud container clusters create hasura-k8s --zone us-west2-a \
       --num-nodes 1 --project hasura
```

## Set up Cloud SQL Proxy Credentials

In order to connect to the Cloud SQL instance, we need to set up a proxy
that will forward connections from Hasura to the database instance. For
that purpose, the credentials to access the instance need to be added to
the cluster.

Create a service account and download the JSON key file by following
[this guide](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/sql-proxy#create-service-account).

Or if you're overwhelmed with that guide, ensure the following:

1.  Enable [Cloud SQL Admin API](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/sqladmin.googleapis.com/overview?project=hasura)
    for your project.
2.  Create a new [Service Account](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts/?project=hasura).
3.  Select `Cloud SQL Admin` as the role.
4.  Click `Create Key` to download the JSON file.

Create a Kubernetes secret with this JSON key file; replace
`[JSON_KEY_FILE_PATH]` with the filename including the complete path of
the download JSON key file.

```bash
kubectl create secret generic cloudsql-instance-credentials \
        --from-file=credentials.json=[JSON_KEY_FILE_PATH]
```

Create another secret with the database username and password (use the
`[PASSWORD]` used earlier):

```bash
kubectl create secret generic cloudsql-db-credentials \
        --from-literal=username=postgres --from-literal=password=[PASSWORD]
```

## Deploy the Hasura GraphQL engine

Download the `deployment.yaml` file:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hasura/graphql-engine/stable/install-manifests/google-cloud-k8s-sql/deployment.yaml
```

Get the `[INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME]` using the following command and
note it down.

```bash
gcloud sql instances describe hasura-postgres \
       --format="value(connectionName)" --project hasura
```

Edit `deployment.yaml` and replace `[INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME]` with
this value. It should look like `hasura:us-west2:hasura-postgres` if
you've followed this guide without modifying any names.

Create the deployment:

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

Ensure the pods are running:

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

If there are any errors, check the logs of the GraphQL engine:

```bash
kubectl logs deployment/hasura -c graphql-engine
```

## Expose GraphQL engine

### HTTP

Now that we have Hasura running, let's expose it on an IP using a
LoadBalancer.

```bash
kubectl expose deploy/hasura \
     --port 80 --target-port 8080 \
     --type LoadBalancer
```

#### Open the Hasura console

Wait for the external IP to be allocated, check the status using the
command below. It usually takes a couple of minutes.

```bash
kubectl get service
```

Once the IP is allocated, visit the IP in a browser and it should open
the console.

### HTTPS

Let's expose Hasura with [Ingress](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/ingress/).
Create service:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  labels:
    app: hasura
  name: hasura
spec:
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
  selector:
    app: hasura
  type: NodePort
```

Create Managed Certificate:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.gke.io/v1beta1
kind: ManagedCertificate
metadata:
  name: hasura-cert
spec:
  domains:
    - example.com
```

Create Ingress:

```yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: basic-ingress
  annotations:
    networking.gke.io/managed-certificates: "hasura-cert"
spec:
  rules:
    - host: example.com
      http:
        paths:
          - backend:
              serviceName: hasura
              servicePort: 80
```

## Logs {#gc-kubernetes-logs}

Check the status for pods to see if they are running. If there are any
errors, check the logs of the GraphQL engine:

```bash
kubectl logs deployment/hasura -c graphql-engine
```

You might also want to check the logs for cloudsql-proxy:

```bash
kubectl logs deployment/hasura -c cloudsql-proxy
```

The username and password used by Hasura to connect to the database
comes from a Kubernetes secret object `cloudsql-db-credentials` that we
created earlier.

## Tearing down

To clean up the resources created, just delete the Google Cloud Project:

```bash
gcloud projects delete hasura
```
