# Health check API Reference

## Introduction

The Health API is a public endpoint which gives info on the server
health.

## Endpoint

All requests are `GET` requests to the `/healthz` endpoint. There's also
`/hasura/healthz` available as an alternative, which mirrors `/healthz`
completely.

## API Spec

### Request

```http
GET /healthz HTTP/1.1
```

### Response

Depending on the server health status any of the following responses can
be returned:

| Server condition                                                          | HTTP Status | Message                              |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|--------------------------------------|
| All healthy                                                               | 200         | OK                                   |
| Serving requests but some metadata objects are inconsistent/not-available | 200         | WARN: inconsistent objects in schema |
| Unhealthy                                                                 | 500         | ERROR                                |

:::info Note

If there are metadata inconsistencies, you should use the Hasura console
or the [get_inconsistent_metadata](/graphql/core/api-reference/metadata-api/manage-metadata.mdx#metadata-get-inconsistent-metadata) metadata API to find out
what the inconsistent objects are and resolve them.

#### Sample response

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
```

## Disabling Health check API

The `healthz` API endpoint is public and cannot be disabled.
