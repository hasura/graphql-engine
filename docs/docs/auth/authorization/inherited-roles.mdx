# Inherited Roles

## Introduction

An inherited role is a way to create a new role which inherits permissions from two or more roles.

Once an inherited role is created, it can be treated as any other role i.e. it can be provided in the `X-Hasura-Role`
session variable. An inherited role derives its roles from a role set.

Inherited roles are useful for when you need to define multiple permission rules which may use overlapping logic on
schema objects and also for greater modularity in role management.

:::tip Supported from

Inherited roles are supported in all general availability (GA) versions of Hasura.

:::

## Creating inherited roles

<Tabs groupId="user-preference" className="api-tabs">
<TabItem value="console" label="Console">

Inherited roles can be created in the Console by going to the `Settings`⚙️ tab and clicking on `Inherited Roles`.

Enter the new inherited role name and click "Create". Select the role set which will comprise it and click "Save Role" to
save your new Inherited Role.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

To add a new inherited role, edit the `metadata -> inherited_roles.yaml` file adding the inherited role definition like
this:

```yaml
- role_name: sample_inherited_role
  role_set:
    - user
    - editor
```

Apply the Metadata by running:

```bash
hasura metadata apply
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="api" label="API">

You can add a inherited role using the
[add_inherited_role Metadata API](/api-reference/metadata-api/inherited-roles.mdx#metadata-add-inherited-role):

```http
POST /v1/metadata HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
X-Hasura-Role: admin

{
  "type": "add_inherited_role",
  "args": {
     "role_name":"sample_inherited_role",
     "role_set":[
        "user",
        "editor"
     ]
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::caution Inherited roles cannot form cycles

For example:

Suppose there are two inherited roles: `inherited_role1`, `inherited_role2` and two non-inherited roles: `role1`,
`role2` and:

- `inherited_role1` inherits from `role1` and `inherited_role2`

- `inherited_role2` inherits from `role2` and `inherited_role1`

The above configuration won't work because `inherited_role1` and `inherited_role2` form a cycle.

:::

## Overriding inherited roles

By default, inherited roles will inherit the permissions from its role set.

If you need to define a different permission than the **inherited one** for a particular entity and role pair, then it
can be done by creating a separate specific permission. After creation, it will override the inherited permission,
if any.

## How the permissions of the inherited role are interpreted

### 1. Select permissions

A select permission is comprised of the following things:

1. Row selection filter
2. Columns accessible to the role
3. Limit
4. Allow aggregation
5. Scalar computed fields accessible to the role

Suppose there are two roles, `role1` gives access to column `C1` with row permission `P1` and `role2` gives access to
columns `C1` and `C2` with row permission `P2`. Consider the following GraphQL query executed with an inherited role
comprised of `role1` and `role2`:

```graphql
query {
  T {
    C1
    C2
  }
}
```

The above GraphQL query will be translated to the following SQL query.

```sql
select (case when (P1 or P2) then C1 else null end) as C1,
       (case when P2 then C2 else null end) as C2
from T
where (P1 or P2)
```

The other parameters of the select permission will be combined in the following manner:

1. Limit - Maximum of the limits will be the limit of the inherited role
2. Allow aggregations - If any of the role allows aggregation, then the inherited role will allow aggregation
3. Scalar computed fields - same as table column fields, as in the above example

#### Accessibility of a field for an inherited role

Accessibility of a field for an inherited role is defined as follows:

1. When all the roles give access to a column `C`, then `C` will always be accessible.
2. When not all, but some of the roles give access to the column `C` then the value of the column `C` will be outputted
   when the OR of `P1,P2....P(n)` is `true` and when it evaluates to `false`, the value of the column `C` will be
   `null`, where `P` is the row filter of the select permissions in which column `C` is given access to.
3. When none of the roles give access to column `C`, it won't be accessible to the inherited role.

#### Inherited select permissions Example 1

Let's take the example of an `users` table with the following columns:

1. `id` - Int - Primary key
2. `name` - Text
3. `email` - Text

There are two roles defined namely `employee` and `manager`.

1. User role - The user role will be able to access all columns of _**their row**_ when the session variable
   `X-Hasura-User-Id` is equal to the `id`.
2. Anonymous role - The anonymous role will be able to access only the `id` and `name` columns of all the users.

Let's create a new inherited role called `user_anonymous_inherited_role` which inherits from the `user` and the
`anonymous` roles.

1.  Executing the query as `user` role

```http
POST /v1/graphql HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
X-Hasura-Role: user
X-Hasura-User-Id: 1
```

<GraphiQLIDE
  query={`query {
  users {
    id
    name
    email
  }
}`}
  response={`{
  "data": {
    "users": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "alice",
        "email": "alice@xyz.com"
      }
    ]
  }
}`}
/>

2.  Executing the query as `anonymous` role

```http
POST /v1/graphql HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
X-Hasura-Role: anonymous
```

<GraphiQLIDE
  query={`query {
  users {
    id
    name
  }
}`}
  response={`{
  "data": {
    "users": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Alice"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "name": "Bob"
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "name": "Sam"
    }
    ]
  }
}`}
/>

3.  Executing the query as `user_anonymous_inherited_role` role

```http
POST /v1/graphql HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
X-Hasura-Role: user_anonymous_inherited_role
X-Hasura-User-Id: 1
```

<GraphiQLIDE
  query={`query {
  users {
    id
    name
    email
  }
 }`}
  response={`{
  "data": {
    "users": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Alice",
      "email": "alice@xyz.com"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "name": "Bob",
      "email": null
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "name": "Sam",
      "email": null
    }
    ]
  }
 }`}
/>

In the response of the query being executed with the `user_anonymous_inherited_role` role, there are 3 rows returned and
if we compare that to the queries executed as the `user` and `anonymous` roles, the results are unioned in the inherited
role.

But some of the fields in some of the results have `null` values despite the value in the database not being
`null`. This can only happen with inherited roles when a column doesn't have permission in the particular row. In
the above example, we see that the `email` of "Bob" and "Sam" is `null` but is populated for "Alice" as the
`X-Hasura-User-Id` session variable on the query is set to the corresponding `id` of that row.

The "Alice" row is executed as the `user` role and the other rows are executed as the `anonymous` role which
is why the value is `null`.


#### Inherited select permissions Example 2

Suppose we have two tables, `users` and `authors`, and similarly two roles `user` and `author` are defined. The
`user` role doesn't have permission to query the `authors` table and the `author` role doesn't have permission to query
the `users` table. With only the `user` and the `author` role, we won't be able to construct a query which
fetches data from both the tables. This can be solved by creating an inherited role out of `user` and `author` which
can query both the tables in a single query.

```http
POST /v1/graphql HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
X-Hasura-Role: user_authors_inherited_role
X-Hasura-User-Id: 1
```

<GraphiQLIDE
  query={`query {
  users {
    id
    name
    email
  }
  authors {
    id
    name
    followers
  }
 }`}
  response={`{
  "data": {
    "users": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Alice",
      "email": "alice@xyz.com"
    }
    ],
    "authors": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Paulo Coelho",
      "followers": 10382193
    }
    ]
  }
 }`}
/>

### 2. Mutation and Remote Schema permissions

A mutation (insert, update and delete) or Remote Schema permission is inherited in the following manner:

Suppose there's an inherited role `R` which inherits permissions from `n` roles in the set namely `pr1`, `pr2`,
`pr3` ...`prn`. The inherited permission for the role `R` on some entity can only be inherited when the permission
on the entity is the same for all roles in the set.

For example, if two insert permissions are configured in the following way:

1. insert permission metadata of role `pr1`

   ```json
   {
     "type": "pg_create_insert_permission",
     "args": {
       "table": "article",
       "source": "default",
       "role": "pr1",
       "permission": {
         "check": {
           "author_id": "X-HASURA-AUTHOR-ID"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. insert permission metadata of the role `pr2`

   ```json
   {
     "type": "pg_create_insert_permission",
     "args": {
       "table": "article",
       "source": "default",
       "role": "pr2",
       "permission": {
         "check": {
           "author_id": "X-HASURA-USER-ID"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

The `check` constraint is different for each of the permissions and there's no way to resolve this conflict.

Whenever a conflict occurs while a role inherits from its role set, then the Metadata for that entity and role
combination will be marked as inconsistent.

These can be seen by calling the
[get_inconsistent_metadata](/api-reference/metadata-api/manage-metadata.mdx#metadata-get-inconsistent-metadata) API.
Following the above example, the role `R` which is trying to inherit permissions from the role `pr1` and `pr2` will be
marked as inconsistent for the table permission of the table `article`.

This inconsistency is informational and can be ignored if the conflicting role entity pair is not going to be used. If
this inconsistency needs to be resolved, then it can be done by adding a permission explicitly for the conflicting role
entity pair.

### 3. Actions and Custom Functions permissions

Inheritance of permissions of Actions and custom functions work in the following way:

If any of the roles in the set have permission configured for a given Action or custom function, then the inherited role
will also be able to access the given action or custom function.
