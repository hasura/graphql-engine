# BigQuery

## Introduction

Hasura allows connecting to a [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery) database and building a GraphQL API based on
the database schema.

:::tip Supported versions:

Hasura GraphQL Engine `v2.0.0-alpha.1` onwards

:::

## Get Started

To try Hasura with BigQuery, you'll need your own new or existing BigQuery database.

Here is how you can get started with Hasura and BigQuery:

[Get started with BigQuery](/databases/bigquery/getting-started/index.mdx)

<!--

 TODO: DB COMPATIBILITY

  1. :ref:`Hasura Cloud <database_bigquery_cloud>`: You'll need to be able to access your BigQuery database from Hasura Cloud.
  2. :ref:`Docker <database_bigquery_docker>`: Run Hasura with Docker and then connect your BigQuery database to Hasura.

 -->

## Minimum required IAM permissions

* BigQuery queries through Hasura require the `bigquery.jobs.create` and `bigquery.jobs.get` permissions to send a job to the BigQuery servers.
* The `bigquery.tables.getData` permission allows Hasura to query your BigQuery data source. Note that mutations are not currently supported for BigQuery, and so no corresponding `updateData` permission is required.
* To use the Hasura Console to edit your data source, several different permissions may be required depending on your actions:
  * `bigquery.datasets.create` and `bigquery.datasets.delete` for creating and deleting datasets.
  * `bigquery.routines.create`, `bigquery.routines.update`, and `bigquery.routines.delete` for managing user-defined functions and stored procedures.
  * `bigquery.table.create`, `bigquery.tables.list`, `bigquery.tables.get`, `bigquery.tables.delete`, and `bigquery.tables.update` to manage the dataset definition.

## Supported features

Hasura currently supports queries and relationships on BigQuery.
