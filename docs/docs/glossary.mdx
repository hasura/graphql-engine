# Glossary

## Docker
Docker is a system which allows the packaging up of code and all its dependencies so the an application runs
quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.

## Docker Container
A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything
needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings. Hasura can be run as a
Docker container.

## Docker Image
Docker images become containers at runtime and in the case of Docker containers â€“ images become containers
when they run on Docker Engine which is available for both Linux and Windows-based applications, containerized
software will always run the same, regardless of the infrastructure. Containers isolate software from its
environment and ensure that it works uniformly despite differences for instance between development and staging.
Hasura is distributed as a Docker image for the Community Edition at
[DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/hasura/graphql-engine).

## GraphQL Schema
Every GraphQL service defines a set of types which completely describe the set of possible data you can query on
that service. This is called the GraphQL schema. Hasura automatically generates a GraphQL Schema for you from the
tables in your connected databases, Hasura Actions you've defined, and other connected GraphQL or REST endpoints.
When queries come in, they are validated and executed against that schema.

## GraphQL query type
Every GraphQL service has a `query` type and may or may not have a mutation type. These types are the same as a
regular object type, but they are special because they define the entry point of every GraphQL query. In Hasura the
query type is generated for you in order to get data from your schema.

[//]: # (TODO query types per table)

## GraphQL mutation type
The GraphQL `mutation` type is an optional type in the GraphQL specification but will be available to you on every
configured Hasura endpoint in order to change or "mutate" data on your database, action or Remote Schema endpoints.

## GraphQL Data Plane for Hasura Enterprise Edition

The container(s) serving the GraphQL API and in the critical path of every request/response.

## Hasura Account
An account on [hasura.io](https://hasura.io) in which multiple cloud instances of Hasura Cloud can be created.

## Hasura GraphQL Engine

The Docker container(s) serving the GraphQL API and in the critical path of every request/response.

## Hasura CE (Community Edition)

The open-source Community Edition of the Hasura GraphQL Engine.

## Hasura Client Name

`Hasura-Client-Name` will be set to `hasura-console` by default. It is used to identify the client who is making the
request in Hasura Pro metrics and monitoring tools.

## Hasura Cloud

The cloud managed, optimised and massively scalable version of Hasura with the option to add the Hasura Enterprise
Edition package and runs as a managed service. Hasura Cloud includes extra reliability, monitoring, caching, tracing,
security and deployment features which aren't available in Hasura Community Edition.

## Hasura Cloud IP

A Hasura Cloud IP will be listed on the Hasura Cloud Dashboard for each project. Hasura will be connecting to your
database from this IP address. If your database is not exposed to the internet, you must allow connections from this
IP address on your firewall settings for Hasura Cloud Project to function properly. Otherwise, Hasura will not be
able to connect to your database and the GraphQL API will not be available.

## Hasura Cloud Project

A Project is an individual GraphQL API hosted by Hasura Cloud. You can create a Project by going to the cloud
dashboard and then connecting a database from the Hasura console. You can also provision a database on cloud
platforms like Heroku from the Hasura console itself.

Each project is allocated a unique auto-generated name and an ID. You can use this name or ID while communicating to
Hasura team regarding this project. Each project is also assigned a GraphQL API endpoint of the format
`https://<project-name>.hasura.app/v1/graphql`.

For example, a project might be called `usable-cobra-29` with ID `bf0ea856-76a2-42c2-8a91-66ca9b9206e8`.

## Hasura Collaborator Token

When you open the Hasura Console on a Cloud Project, you will not be asked to enter the admin secret like Hasura
Community Edition version. Instead, if you are an admin, the console will be accessible with the admin secret already
set, or if you are a collaborator with limited access you will be automatically logged into the Console via an
OAuth2.0 based authorization flow. You will be given the right access based on your permissions for the particular
Hasura Cloud Project.

After the login process is complete, you'll see a new header called `Hasura-Collaborator-Token` in the "Request
Headers" section of GraphiQL. This token is used instead of admin secret to authenticate and authorize all the
requests made from the Console. The token is only valid for 5mins and is refreshed silently by the Console. It is to
be used only from Console.

For accessing the API from other clients, use the admin secret or create a Personal Access Token.

## Hasura EE (Enterprise Edition)

Hasura Enterprise edition that includes a self-hosted control plane.

## Lux _or_ Control Plane (Enterprise Edition)

A set of services that powers the Hasura Enterprise Edition Control Plane that allows for user/team management,
managing Hasura GraphQL configuration and includes a monitoring plane that ingests Hasura & GraphQL API metrics and
makes it available over a UI and an API.
