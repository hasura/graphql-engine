# Project Collaborators

## Introduction

You can invite collaborators to your project and grant them partial or complete access to your Hasura console. The `Collaborators` tab shows the current people who have access to the project and the people who have been invited to the project.

## Invite a collaborator

Click `Invite a Collaborator` to invite a new collaborator by their email.

### Collaborator roles

Collaborators can have different levels of access in the Hasura console.

- **Admin** has complete access to the console, i.e. they can change the schema and the GraphQL engine metadata.
- **User** has limited privileges:
  - The `Execute GraphQL` permission allows running queries, mutations and subscriptions from the `GraphiQL` tab of the console.
  - The `View Metrics` permission allows inspecting operation data and metrics from the `PRO` tab of the console.
  - Collaborators can also be invited to take billing responsibility for a project; see the [billing owner](/graphql/cloud/billing/billing-owner.mdx) page for more information.
