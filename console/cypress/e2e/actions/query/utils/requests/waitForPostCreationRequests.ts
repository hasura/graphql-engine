/**
 * Wait for a bunch of requests to be settled before proceeding with the test.
 *
 * Alternatively, https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-network-idle could be used
 *
 * This is a workaround for "element is 'detached' from the DOM" Cypress' error (see the issue
 * linked below). Since the UI gets re-rendered because of the requests, this utility ensures that
 * all the requests parallelly made by the UI are settled before proceeding with the test. Hance, it
 * ensure the UI won't re-render during the next interaction.
 *
 * What are the requests that must be awaited? By looking at the Cypress Test Runner, they are the
 * following, made parallelly or in a rapid series.
 * 1. export_metadata
 * 2. export_metadata
 * 3. export_metadata
 * 4. test_webhook_transform
 * 5. test_webhook_transform
 * 6. test_webhook_transform
 * 7. test_webhook_transform
 * At the moment of writing, I'm not sure the number of requests are fixed or not. If they are fixed,
 * using the cy.intercept `times` options would result in a more expressive and less convoluted code.
 *
 * To give you an overall idea, this is a timeline of the requests
 *
 *         all requests start                             all requests end
 *         |                 |                            |               |
 * |--🚦🔴--1--2--3--4--5--6--7----------------------------1--2--3--4--5--6-7--🚦🟢--|
 *
 *
 * ATTENTION: Despite the defensive approach and the flakiness-removal purpose, this function could
 * introduced even more flakiness because of its empiric approach. In case of failures, it must be
 * carefully evaluated when/if keeping it or thinking about a better approach.
 * In generale, this solution does not scale, at should not be spread among the tests.
