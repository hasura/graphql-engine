# Disable GraphQL introspection

<div className='badge badge--primary heading-badge'>Available on: Cloud, Enterprise Edition</div>

## Introduction

The GraphQL engine by default enables
[GraphQL Schema Introspection](https://spec.graphql.org/June2018/#sec-Schema-Introspection) which gives full information
about the schema and may not be desired in production.

To avoid this, you can disable GraphQL introspection on a per-role basis.

## Disabling GraphQL introspection for a role

Introspection can be disabled for a role as shown below:
