# OpenTelemetry Integration

## Introduction
You can export traces of your Hasura Cloud project to the [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) compliant APM receiver.
This can be configured on the integrations tab on the project's setting page.

:::info Note

The OpenTelemetry Integration is only available for Hasura Cloud projects on the `Standard` (pay-as-you-go) tier and above.

:::

:::info Note

Currently, the OpenTelemetry Integration exports only traces. The support for metrics and logs will be added once the
OpenTelemetry spec reaches [stability](https://opentelemetry.io/status/#current-status).

:::

## Configure the OpenTelemetry integration

Navigate to the `Integrations` tab on the project settings page to find the OpenTelemetry integration.

The following config parameters are needed to set up the integration with the APM receiver:

1. #### Endpoint

    OpenTelemetry compliant receiver [endpoint](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/reference/specification/protocol/exporter/#configuration-options).
    The URL scheme (`http`/`https`) determines if SSL(TLS) should be used for the communication. The APM vendor documentation
    contains the OpenTelemetry Ingestion endpoint information. The appropriate endpoint for the chosen **Connection Type**
    should be used since the APM tools usually have different endpoints for `HTTP` and `gRPC` protocols.

2. #### Connection Type

    Protocol to be used for the communication with the receiver. OpenTelemetry supports connections over `gRPC` and `HTTP`.
    The APM vendor documentation contains the protocols it supports for OpenTelemetry ingestion, and `gRPC` can be preferred
    if it supports both `gRPC` and `HTTP`.

3. #### Batch Size

    Batch size is the maximum number of data points (spans in the context of traces) included in every export request made to the APM tool.
    The batch size should be an integer between 1 and 512.

4. #### Headers

    Headers are <em>(optionally)</em> added to every request made by the integration to the APM receiver. APM vendors
    usually provide **Authorization/API keys** (if needed, with the role/permission to ingest OpenTelemetry data) and
    their documentation contains the format in which they have to be used as a request header. It should be added here
    as a `key:value` pair.

5. #### Attributes

    Attributes are <em>(optional)</em> custom tags added to the telemetry data. This is usually used to identify sources in a
    distributed tracing environment and aids granular filtering/analytics.

6. #### Export Telemetry Data

    Selects the telemetry data points to be exported. (Note: Currently only traces are supported).

After adding appropriate values in the OpenTelemetry Integration panel, click <em>Connect Integration</em>.

## Checking the status of the integration

The green/red dot signifies the status of the integration. The green dot signifies successful exporting of the telemetry
data to the APM receiver. `Last Exported Traces` is continuously updated, indicating the timestamp of the last telemetry successfully exported.
The orange dot reading `Not exported yet` means no requests have been made to the GraphQL API after configuring the integration.

/>

In case of error while exporting telemetry data to the APM receiver, the dot becomes red and
the error messages/instructions are displayed. Click the ``Update Settings`` button to update the config parameters.

## View traces

The APM target for the traces have their own UI to visualise and do further analytics on trace data. Usually, the traces
with their spans are listed out and selecting a trace shows a flame graph containing a visual representation of where
the operation spent its execution over time. For example, the below image contains a flame graph in `Jaeger` where
a query took 5.64 milliseconds in total, of which 2.78 milliseconds was the actual Postgres database processing the query.

## OpenTelemetry collector

OpenTelemetry provides a [collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/) to export data to APM tools that do not
support native OpenTelemetry ingestion. In such cases, this OpenTelemetry integration can be configured to send the
data to the collector (which should be run in your infrastructure and reachable by the Hasura backend) which is configured
to send the data to the APM target. The list of [supported exporter targets](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/exporter)
can be found in the [OpenTelemetry Collector repository](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib).
