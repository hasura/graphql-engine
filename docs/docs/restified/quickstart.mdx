# Quickstart RESTified Endpoints

RESTified endpoints allow you to quickly and easily create REST endpoints without writing custom code. This quickstart
will walk you through the process of creating a REST endpoint from a GraphQL query.

## Step 1: Write a query

From the `API` tab of the Hasura Console, create a query:

<GraphiQLIDE
  query={`query SingleProductsQuery($id: uuid!) {
  products_by_pk(id: $id) {
    id
    name
    description
  }
}
`}
  variables={`{"id": "7992fdfa-65b5-11ed-8612-6a8b11ef7372" }`}
  response={`{
  "data": {
    "products_by_pk": {
      "id": "7992fdfa-65b5-11ed-8612-6a8b11ef7372",
      "name": "The Original Tee",
      "description": "When you want to keep it simple"
    }
  }
}`}
/>

After entering the query, click the `REST` button in the Explorer to configure your endpoint:

  width="1000px"
/>

## Step 2: RESTify it

Enter a name:

```
single_product_query
```

Followed by a brief description if you wish:

```
Retrieve a single product using its id
```

Next, we'll provide a route that describes the endpoint's purpose and indicates that we wish to accept a query parameter
of `id` for the product:

```
product/:id
```

We'll mark `GET` as the allowed method and finish creating the endpoint by clicking `Create`.

  width="1000px"
/>

## Step 3: üçø

To test this endpoint, run the following curl request in your terminal:

```bash
curl -H "x-hasura-admin-secret: <YOUR_ADMIN_SECRET>" https://<YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>.hasura.app/api/rest/product/7992fdfa-65b5-11ed-8612-6a8b11ef7372
```

You should see a response similar to this:

```json
{
  "products_by_pk": {
    "id": "7992fdfa-65b5-11ed-8612-6a8b11ef7372",
    "name": "The Original Tee",
    "description": "When you want to keep it simple"
  }
}
```

## Recap

What just happened? Well, you just created a REST endpoint without writing a single line of code üéâ

This saves you
significant time and effort, as you can convert any query or mutation into a REST endpoint with just a few clicks.

While we created this endpoint from the Console, you can also [utilize the API](/api-reference/restified.mdx) to
generate these endpoints for any project.

You have complete control in defining the endpoint, but in this example we followed RESTful best practices to identify
the endpoint using `product` as the pathname and then `:id` as the argument. **Any arguments should match the variables
included in the query or mutation, as Hasura expects these values to be passed via the endpoint.**

By using RESTified endpoints, you can take advantage of the benefits of both REST and GraphQL,
making your Hasura project even more versatile and powerful. For more details, check out the
[configuration page](/restified/restified-config.mdx).
