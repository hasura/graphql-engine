# Authentication using webhooks

## Introduction

You can configure the GraphQL engine to use a webhook to authenticate all incoming requests to the Hasura GraphQL engine
server.

:::info Prerequisite

It is mandatory to first [secure your GraphQL endpoint](/graphql/core/deployment/securing-graphql-endpoint.mdx) for the
webhook mode to take effect.

:::

In webhook mode, on a secured endpoint:

- The configured webhook is **called** when the `X-Hasura-Admin-Secret` header is not found in the request.
- The configured webhook is **ignored** when the `X-Hasura-Admin-Secret` header is found in the request and admin access
  is granted.

## Configuring webhook mode

- You can configure Hasura to run in webhook mode by running the GraphQL engine with the `--auth-hook` flag or the
  `HASURA_GRAPHQL_AUTH_HOOK` environment variable (see
  [GraphQL engine server options](/graphql/core/deployment/graphql-engine-flags/reference.mdx)), the value of which is
  the webhook endpoint.
- You can configure Hasura to send either a `GET` or a `POST` request to your auth webhook. The default configuration is
  `GET` and you can override this with `POST` by using the `--auth-hook-mode` flag or the
  `HASURA_GRAPHQL_AUTH_HOOK_MODE` environment variable (_in addition to those specified above; see_
  [GraphQL engine server options](/graphql/core/deployment/graphql-engine-flags/reference.mdx)).

:::info Note

If you are running Hasura using Docker, ensure that the Hasura Docker container can reach the webhook. See
[this page](/graphql/core/guides/docker-networking.mdx) for Docker networking.

## Spec for the webhook

### Request

#### GET request

```http
GET https://<your-custom-webhook>/ HTTP/1.1
<Header-Key>: <Header-Value>
```

If you configure your webhook to use `GET`, then Hasura **will forward all client headers except**:

- `Content-Length`
- `Content-Type`
- `Content-MD5`
- `User-Agent`
- `Host`
- `Origin`
- `Referer`
- `Accept`
- `Accept-Encoding`
- `Accept-Language`
- `Accept-Datetime`
- `Cache-Control`
- `Connection`
- `DNT`

#### POST request

POST requests will receive the contents of the request body in addition to client headers. Given a request like

```graphql
query UserQuery($a: Int) {
  users(where: { id: { _eq: $a } }) {
    id
  }
}
```

with variables <em>{"a": 1}</em>, the webhook will receive a request of the following form:

```http
POST https://<your-custom-webhook>/ HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "headers": {
    "header-key1": "header-value1",
    "header-key2": "header-value2"
  },
  "request": {
    "variables": {
      "a": 1
    },
    "operationName": "UserQuery",
    "query": "query UserQuery($a:  Int) {\n  users(where:  {id:  {_eq:  $a}}){\n    id\n  }\n}\n"
  }
}
```

If you configure your webhook to use `POST`, then Hasura **will send all client headers in payload**.

:::info Note

If an invalid JSON request is sent, then the request body is not forwarded to the webhook

:::

### Response {#webhook-response}

#### Success

To allow the GraphQL request to go through, your webhook must return a `200` status code. You should send the
`X-Hasura-*` "session variables" to your permission rules in Hasura.

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "X-Hasura-User-Id": "25",
    "X-Hasura-Role": "user",
    "X-Hasura-Is-Owner": "true",
    "X-Hasura-Custom": "custom value"
}
```

:::info Note

All values should be `String`. They will be converted to the right type automatically.

:::

There is no default timeout on the resulting connection. You can optionally add one; to do so, you need to return
either:

- a `Cache-Control` variable, modeled on the
  [Cache-Control HTTP Header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control), to specify a
  **relative** expiration time, in seconds.

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "X-Hasura-User-Id": "26",
    "X-Hasura-Role": "user",
    "X-Hasura-Is-Owner": "false",
    "Cache-Control": "max-age=600"
}
```

- an `Expires` variable, modeled on the
  [Expires HTTP Header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Expires), to specify an **absolute**
  expiration time. The expected format is `"%a, %d %b %Y %T GMT"`.

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "X-Hasura-User-Id": "27",
    "X-Hasura-Role": "user",
    "X-Hasura-Is-Owner": "false",
    "Expires": "Mon, 30 Mar 2020 13:25:18 GMT"
}
```

:::info Note

If the <em>Set-Cookie</em> headers are set by the auth webhook, they are forwarded by the GraphQL Engine as response
headers for both GET/POST request methods.

:::

#### Failure

If you want to deny the GraphQL request, return a `401 Unauthorized` exception.

```http
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
```

:::info Note

Anything other than a `200` or `401` response from webhook makes the server raise a `500 Internal Server Error`
exception.

:::

## Auth webhook samples

We have put together a
[GitHub Node.js repo](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/tree/master/community/boilerplates/auth-webhooks/nodejs-express)
that has some sample auth webhooks configured.

You can deploy these samples using [glitch](https://glitch.com/):

[<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hasura/sample-auth-webhook/master/assets/deploy-glitch.png" className="no-shadow" width="200" alt="deploy_auth_webhook_with_glitch" />](http://glitch.com/edit/#!/import/github/hasura/sample-auth-webhook)

Once deployed, you can use any of the following endpoints as your auth webhook in the GraphQL engine:

- `/simple/webhook`
  ([View source](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/blob/master/community/boilerplates/auth-webhooks/nodejs-express/server.js))
- `/firebase/webhook`
  ([View source](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/blob/master/community/boilerplates/auth-webhooks/nodejs-firebase/firebase/firebaseHandler.js))

:::info Note

If you are using `Firebase`, you will have to set the associated environment variables.
