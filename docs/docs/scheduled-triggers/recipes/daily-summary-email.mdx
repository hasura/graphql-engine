# Send a Daily Summary Email

Scheduled Triggers allows you to schedule business, or other logic to occur at specific times or intervals. In this
guide, we'll explore how to use Scheduled Triggers to send each user a daily summary of recent notifications which they
have received. We'll do this by executing this trigger every morning and seeing what new notifications have come through
in the last twenty-four hours. If a user has new notifications, they'll get an email listing them all.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure that you have the following in place:

- A Hasura project, either locally or using [Hasura Cloud](https://cloud.hasura.io/?skip_onboarding=true).
- A working SMTP server or email-sending service that you can integrate with to send emails.
- If you plan on using a webhook endpoint hosted on your own machine with a Hasura project hosted elsewhere, ensure that
  you have a tunneling service such as [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) set up so that a remotely hosted instance can
  communicate with your local machine.

## Our model

When sending transactionary emails such as this, there are three fundamental components to consider:

- **Your data source**: In your database, which table contains the value that you want to use to determine whether or
  not to send the email?
- **Your querying logic**: In your webhook, how will you query your database to determine whether or not to send the
  email? How will you return information so that you have the correct data to include in the email?
- **Your email templating**: How will you generate and send the email containing the information you want to send?

For simplicity, we're assuming there are two tables in our database: `users` and `notifications`. The `users` table
contains the details of all users, including the user's email address. The `notifications` table contains all
notifications sent to users. Each notification has a `user_id` property that references the user to whom the
notification was sent.

<details>
<summary>

</summary>

```sql
-- create the users table
CREATE TABLE public.users (
    id uuid PRIMARY KEY,
    email varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    name varchar(100) NOT NULL
);

-- create the notifications table
CREATE TABLE public.notifications (
    id serial PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES public.users(id),
    message text NOT NULL,
    created_at timestamp DEFAULT now()
);

-- seed data for the users table
INSERT INTO public.users (id, email, name) VALUES
    ('6f809f39-07a1-4c3b-a5e5-8e6d905366f1', 'user1@example.com', 'Daniel Ricciardo'),
    ('d0f29c98-c789-4ec0-b84c-1593a6a8d0c2', 'user2@example.com', 'Charles Leclerc'),
    ('acde545e-32d3-4f28-9475-61ab26a555d9', 'user3@example.com', 'Carlos Sainz');

-- seed data for the notifications table
INSERT INTO public.notifications (user_id, message, created_at) VALUES
    ('6f809f39-07a1-4c3b-a5e5-8e6d905366f1', 'Your order has been shipped!', NOW() - INTERVAL '30 hours'),
    ('d0f29c98-c789-4ec0-b84c-1593a6a8d0c2', 'New product added: Smartphone XYZ is now available!', NOW() - INTERVAL '30 hours'),
    ('acde545e-32d3-4f28-9475-61ab26a555d9', 'Special offer: Get 20% off on all electronics!', NOW() - INTERVAL '30 hours');
```

You can copy / paste this into the `RUN SQL` tab in the Hasura Console on the `Data` page. Then, track all relationships
under the `Public` schema on the `Data` page.

## Step 1: Create the Scheduled Event

Head to your the Hasura Console of your project and navigate to the "Events" tab. From there, click on the
`Cron Triggers` item in the sidebar. Then, click `Create`:

  width="1000"
/>

## Step 2: Configure the Scheduled Event

First, provide a name for your trigger, e.g., `daily_recap_email`. Then, enter a webhook URL that will be called when
the event is triggered. This webhook will be responsible for sending the summary email and can be hosted anywhere, and
written in any language, you like.

In the example below, if we're using Docker, we'll use a webhook endpoint hosted on our own machine running on port
`4000`. Let's enter the following URL to allow Docker to communicate with the host machine:

```
http://host.docker.internal:4000/review-request
```

:::info Tunneling your webhook endpoint

If you're not running your Hasura instance on the same machine as your webhook endpoint, you'll need to use a tunneling
service such as [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to expose your webhook endpoint to the internet. This will allow you to
expose a public URL that will forward requests to your local machine and the server we'll configure below.

You'll need to modify your webhook URL to use the public URL provided by ngrok.

:::

Next, we'll configure the cron expression that will trigger the event. In this example, we want to send requests at 9:00
AM every morning. We can do that with the following cron expression:

```
0 9 * * *
```

Our trigger must also have a payload. This payload will be sent to the webhook endpoint when the event is triggered. We
don't have to include any data in the payload, but we can if we want to. In this example, we'll simply send a
`trigger_type` property categorizing the event as a `daily_recap_email`. In the `Payload` section, enter the following:

```json
{
  "trigger_type": "daily_recap_email"
}
```

Under `Advanced Settings`, we can configure the headers that will be sent with the request. We'll add an
`authentication` header to prevent abuse of the endpoint and ensure that only Hasura can trigger the event. Set the
`Key` as `secret-authorization-string` and the `Value` as `super_secret_string_123`.

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/scheduled-triggers/scheduled-triggers_recipes_review-request_auth-header.png"
  alt="Hasura Scheduled Trigger architecture"
  width="1000"
/>

Also, change the `Request Transform Options` to `POST` so that the payload is sent in the request body.

Finally, click the `Add Cron Trigger` button to create the Scheduled Event.

## Step 3: Create a webhook to handle the request

Whenever a cron job is triggered, Hasura will send a request to the webhook URL you provided. In this example, we're
simply going to send a `POST` request. Our webhook will parse the request, ensure the header is correct, and then query
the database to determine which customers should receive a summary of their new notifications.

Below, we've written an example of webhook in JavaScript. As we established earlier, this runs on port `4000`. If you're
attempting to run this locally, follow the instructions below. If you're running this in a hosted environment, use this
code as a guide to write your own webhook.

Init a new project with `npm init` and install the following dependencies:

```bash
npm install express nodemailer
```

<details>
<summary>
Then, create a new file called <code>index.js</code> and add the following code:
</summary>

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const nodemailer = require('nodemailer');

const app = express();

// Create a Nodemailer transporter using Ethereal email service
// Ideally, this configuration would be stored somewhere else
nodemailer.createTestAccount((err, account) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error('Failed to create a testing account. ' + err.message);
    return process.exit(1);
  }

  // If all goes as planned, here's the console telling us we're 👍
  console.log('Credentials obtained, listening on the webhook...');

  // Create a transporter object for nodemailer
  const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
    host: 'smtp.ethereal.email',
    port: 587,
    secure: false,
    auth: {
      user: account.user,
      pass: account.pass,
    },
  });

  // Our route for the webhook
  app.post('/review-request', async (req, res) => {
    // confirm the auth header is correct — ideally, you'd keep the secret in an environment variable
    const authHeader = req.headers['secret-authorization-string'];
    if (authHeader !== 'super_secret_string_123') {
      return res.status(401).json({
        message: 'Unauthorized',
      });
    }

    // get our date ready for the query
    const today = new Date();
    const twentyFourHoursPrior = new Date(today.setDate(today.getDate() - 1));
    const twentyFourHoursPriorAsTimestamp = twentyFourHoursPrior.toISOString().split('T')[0];

    // Fetch the data from our Hasura instance
    async function getRecentNotifications() {
      const response = await fetch('http://localhost:8080/v1/graphql', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
          'Content-Type': 'application/json',
          // "x-hasura-admin-secret": "<YOUR-ADMIN-KEY>",
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
          query: `
          query DailyNotificationsQuery($start_time: timestamp!) {
            users {
                id
                email
                name
                notifications(where: {created_at: {_gte: $start_time}}) {
                id
                message
                }
            }
            }
          `,
          variables: {
            start_time: twentyFourHoursPriorAsTimestamp,
          },
        }),
      });
      const { data } = await response.json();
      return data.users;
    }

    // get our users and filter out the ones with no notifications
    let users = await getRecentNotifications();
    users = users.filter(user => user.notifications.length > 0);

    // helper function to list the notifications in the email
    function listNotifications(notifications) {
      let list = '';
      notifications.map(notification => {
        list += `- ${notification.message}\n`;
      });
      return list;
    }

    // map over the data and send an email to each user
    async function sendReviewRequests() {
      let outcomes = [];
      users.map(async user => {
        // Create a message object
        const message = {
          from: 'SuperStore.com <sender@SuperStore.com>',
          to: `${user.name} <${user.email}>`,
          subject: `You've got new notifications, ${user.name.split(' ')[0]}!`,
          text: `Hi ${user.name.split(' ')[0]},\n\nCheck out your recent notifications:\n\n${listNotifications(
            user.notifications
          )}`,
        };

        // Send the message using the Nodemailer transporter
        const info = await transporter.sendMail(message);

        // Log the message info
        console.log(`\nMessage sent to ${user.name}: ${nodemailer.getTestMessageUrl(info)}`);

        // add the info to the outcomes array
        outcomes.push({
          messageId: info.messageId,
          previewUrl: nodemailer.getTestMessageUrl(info),
        });
        return outcomes;
      });
    }

    await sendReviewRequests(users);

    // Return a JSON response to the client
    res.json({
      message: 'Review requests sent!',
    });
  });

  // Start the server
  app.listen(4000, () => {
    console.log('Server started on port 4000');
  });
});
```

</details>

You can run the server by running `node index.js` in your terminal. If you see the message
`Webhook server is running on port 4000`, you're good to go!

## Step 4: Test the setup

With your server running, Hasura should start hitting our endpoint. As we set our cron expression to `0 9 * * *`, the
webhook will be triggered at 9:00 AM every day. We don't want to wait that long to test it. For now, update the
expression to `* * * * *` to trigger the webhook every minute. Then, check out your invocation logs in the Hasura
Console to verify that the webhook was triggered successfully and your terminal to see the outputted information and
link to a handy email 🎉

Feel free to customize the webhook implementation based on your specific requirements and chosen email sending service.
Remember to handle error scenarios, implement necessary validations, and add appropriate security measures to your
webhook endpoint.
