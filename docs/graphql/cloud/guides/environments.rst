Introduction
------------

:ref:`This general guide <guide_environments>` discusses how to approach various stages of development with Hasura.
This page builds on that and introduces aspects that are specific to Hasura Cloud

Moving to Staging
-----------------

Running tests - regression testing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A good development workflow would require that tests be run 1) early in the development process, 
and 2) automatically with changes, to ensure changes to the schema donâ€™t break functionality.

As you keep making schema changes, running regression tests on Hasura Cloud will ensure you are not making unwanted breaking changes.

.. note::

    Read more about :ref:`regression testing with Hasura <regression_tests>`.

Setting up CI/CD
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In addition to other commands, you may want to run ``hasura pro regression-tests run`` as part of your CI/CD workflow.

Maintenance / updates
---------------------




Updating ENV via API
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Hasura Cloud exposes GraphQL APIs to update environment variables or even create projects from scratch. 
For example, to update a few environment variables, you can make a mutation via the API like in the following example:

.. code-block:: graphql

    mutation updateTenantEnv {
      updateTenantEnv(
        tenantId: "7a79cf94-0e53-4520-a560-1b02bf522f08"
        currentHash: "6902a395d70072fbf8d36288f0eacc36c9d82e68"
        envs: [
          { key: "HASURA_GRAPHQL_ENABLE_CONSOLE", value: "false" },
          { key: "ACTIONS_ENDPOINT", value: "https://my-actions-endpoint.com/actions" }
        ]
      ) {
          hash
          envVars
        }
    }
