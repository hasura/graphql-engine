# Connecting Hasura to a Digital Ocean Postgres Database

## Introduction

This guide explains how to connect a new or existing
[Digital Ocean Postgres](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/managed-databases-postgresql) database to a Hasura
instance, either on [Hasura Cloud](https://cloud.hasura.io) or via one of our
[self-hosted](/deployment/deployment-guides/index.mdx) solutions. If you're exploring Digital Ocean Postgres and are
interested in migrating an existing Postgres database - such as from Heroku - check out their
[docs](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/databases/postgresql/how-to/migrate/) before continuing below.

:::info Note

If you plan on using Hasura Cloud, which we recommend, follow steps 1 and 2 below. If you're self-hosting a Hasura instance and
already have a project running, skip to [step 3](#create-pg-db-do).

:::

## Step 1: Sign up or log in to Hasura Cloud

Navigate to [Hasura Cloud](https://cloud.hasura.io/signup/?pg=docs&plcmt=body&cta=navigate-to-hasura-cloud&tech=default)
and sign up or log in.

## Step 2: Create a Hasura Cloud project {#create-hasura-project-do}

On the Hasura Cloud dashboard, create a new project:

<Thumbnail src='/img/cloud-dbs/create-hasura-cloud-project.png' alt='Create Hasura Cloud project' />

After the project is initialized successfully, click on `Launch Console` to open the Hasura Console in your browser.

On the Hasura Console, navigate to the `Data` tab and choose `Connect Existing Database`. Hasura will prompt you for a
Postgres Database URL. We'll create this in the next step and then come back here.

## Step 3: Create a Postgres DB on Digital Ocean {#create-pg-db-do}

Log into [Digital Ocean](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/).

On the top right, click the `Create` button. Then click on `Databases`:

<Thumbnail src='/img/cloud-dbs/do/create-database.png' alt='Create database on Digital Ocean' />

Scroll down and choose a `Cluster configuration`, as well as a `Datacenter` based on your requirements.

Scroll to the bottom and choose a unique database cluster name. Also, select a project the new database will be
associated with.

Then click `Create a Database Cluster`.

## Step 4: Allow connections to your DB from Hasura

Navigate to the database cluster's `Overview` page:

<Thumbnail src='/img/cloud-dbs/do/db-settings.png' alt='Navigate to database settings in Digital Ocean' />

Scroll down to `Trusted sources` and click the `Edit` button:

<Thumbnail src='/img/cloud-dbs/do/edit-trusted-sources.png' alt='Edit trusted sources for database in Digital Ocean' />

If you're using Hasura Cloud, you can quickly find your IP address from the `Hasura Cloud IP` field on the project's
details view:

:::info Note

If you're using a self-hosted solution, you'll need to determine the IP address manually depending on your hosting
service.

:::

Enter the Hasura IP address that you copied:

<Thumbnail src='/img/cloud-dbs/do/add-hasura-ip.png' alt='Add Hasura IP to database in Digital Ocean' width='700px' />

Then click `Save`.

:::info Note

If you're using a database user other than the default one, make sure to give it the right
[Postgres permissions](/deployment/postgres-requirements.mdx#managed-pg-permissions).

:::

## Step 5: Get the database connection URL {#get-db-url-do}

The structure of the database connection URL looks as follows:

```bash
postgresql://<user-name>:<password>@<public-ip>:<postgres-port>/<db>?sslmode=require
```

To get it, navigate to the database cluster's `Overview` page:

<Thumbnail src='/img/cloud-dbs/do/db-overview.png' alt='Navigate to database overview in Digital Ocean' />

Scroll down to `Connection details`. Select `Public network` on the left and `Connection string` on the right.

<Thumbnail

  alt='Get the database connection string in Digital Ocean'
  width='600px'
/>

Then click the `Copy` button for the next step.

## Step 6: Finish connecting the database

Back on the Hasura Console, enter the database URL that we retrieved in [step 5](#get-db-url-do):

<Thumbnail src='/img/cloud-dbs/do/DO-complete.png' alt='Database setup' width='600px' />

Then click `Connect Database`.

:::info Note

For security reasons, it is recommended to set database URLs as
[env vars](/projects/env-vars.mdx#manage-project-env-vars) and using the env vars to connect to the databases in place
of the raw database URLs.

:::

Voilà. You are ready to start developing.

## Next steps

- You can check out our [30-Minute Hasura Basics Course](https://hasura.io/learn/graphql/hasura/introduction/) and other
  [GraphQL & Hasura Courses](https://hasura.io/learn/) for a more detailed introduction to Hasura.

- If using Hasura Cloud, you can also click the gear icon to manage your Hasura Cloud project. (e.g. add
  [collaborators](/projects/collaborators.mdx#manage-project-collaborators),
  [env vars](/projects/env-vars.mdx#manage-project-env-vars) or
  [custom domains](/projects/domains.mdx#manage-project-domains)).
