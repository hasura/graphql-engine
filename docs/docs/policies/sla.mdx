# Hasura Cloud Service Level Agreement (SLA)

<ProductBadge pro ee />

## Introduction

This document describes the Service Level Agreement (SLA) calculation and crediting process for Hasura Cloud. The SLA
applies to paid tiers in Hasura Cloud.

## Service Availability

We calculate SLA uptime monthly and measure uptime with an HTTP request to the `/v1/version` endpoint on a project at a
regular interval.

Cloud Professional users can find more detail regarding uptime in our
[terms of service](https://hasura.io/legal/hasura-cloud-terms-of-service/). Cloud Enterprise users should reference
their contracts for details.

## Credits

If the SLA for your tier is not met, you are eligible for credit. We calculate the credit amount as a percentage of the
monthly subscription fee for affected Hasura Cloud projects.

To request credits, you must notify the [Hasura Support team](https://cloud.hasura.io/support/create-ticket) within
thirty days from when you become eligible to receive credit. Failure to comply with this requirement will forfeit your
right to receive credit.
