# Kodiak's configuration file should be placed at `.kodiak.toml` (repository
# root) or `.github/.kodiak.toml`.
# docs: https://kodiakhq.com/docs/config-reference

# version is the only required setting in a kodiak config.
# `1` is the only valid setting for this field.

[merge]
# Label to enable Kodiak to merge a PR.

# By default, Kodiak will only act on PRs that have this label. You can disable
# this requirement via `merge.require_automerge_label`.
automerge_label = "auto-update-auto-merge"

# Require that the automerge label (`merge.automerge_label`) be set for Kodiak
# to merge a PR.
#
# When disabled, Kodiak will immediately attempt to merge any PR that passes all
# GitHub branch protection requirements.
require_automerge_label = true

# If a PR's title matches this regex, Kodiak will not merge the PR. This is
# useful to prevent merging work-in-progress PRs.
#
# Setting `merge.blocking_title_regex = ""` disables this option.
blocking_title_regex = "" # default: "^WIP:.*", options: "" (disables regex), a regex string (e.g. ".*DONT\s*MERGE.*")

# Kodiak will not merge a PR with any of these labels.
blocking_labels = ["s/do-not-merge", "s/wip"] # default: []

# Choose merge method for Kodiak to use.
#
# Kodiak will report a configuration error if the selected merge method is
# disabled for a repository.
#
# If you're using the "Require signed commits" GitHub Branch Protection setting
# to require commit signatures, "merge" or "squash" are the only compatible options. "rebase" will cause Kodiak to raise a configuration error.
method = "squash" # default: "merge", options: "merge", "squash", "rebase"

# Once a PR is merged, delete the branch. This option behaves like the GitHub
# repository setting "Automatically delete head branches", which automatically
# deletes head branches after pull requests are merged.
delete_branch_on_merge = true # default: false

# If there is a merge conflict, make a comment on the PR and remove the
# automerge label. This option only applies when `merge.require_automerge_label`
# is enabled.
notify_on_conflict = true # default: true

# Don't wait for in-progress status checks on a PR to finish before updating the
# branch.
optimistic_updates = true # default: true

# Don't wait for specified status checks when merging a PR. If a configured
# status check is incomplete when a PR is being merged, Kodiak will skip the PR.
# Use this option for status checks that run indefinitely, like deploy jobs or
# the WIP GitHub App.
dont_wait_on_status_checks = [] # default: [], options: list of check names (e.g. ["ci/circleci: lint_api"])

# If a PR is passing all checks and is able to be merged, merge it without
# placing it in the merge queue. This option adds some unfairness where PRs
# waiting in the queue the longest are not served first.
prioritize_ready_to_merge = true # default: false

# Never merge a PR. This option can be used with `update.always` to
# automatically update a PR without merging.
do_not_merge = false # default: false

[merge.message]
# By default (`"github_default"`), GitHub uses the title of a PR's first commit
# for the merge commit title. `"pull_request_title"` uses the PR title for the
# merge commit.

# By default (`"github_default"`), GitHub combines the titles of a PR's commits
# to create the body text of a merge commit. `"pull_request_body"` uses the
# content of the PR to generate the body content while `"empty"` sets an empty
# body.
body = "pull_request_body" # default: "github_default", options: "github_default", "pull_request_body", "empty"

# Append the Pull Request URL to the merge message. Makes navigating to the PR
# from the commit easier.

# Add the PR number to the merge commit title. This setting replicates GitHub's
# behavior of automatically adding the PR number to the title of merges created
# through the UI. This option only applies when `merge.message.title` does not
# equal `"github_default"`.
include_pr_number = false # default: true

# Control the text used in the merge commit. The GitHub default is markdown, but
# `"plain_text"` or `"html"` can be used to render the pull request body as text
# or HTML. This option only applies when `merge.message.body = "pull_request_body"`.
body_type = "markdown" # default: "markdown", options: "plain_text", "markdown", "html"

# This setting is useful for stripping HTML comments created by PR templates.
# This option only applies when `merge.message.body_type = "markdown"`.
strip_html_comments = true # default: false

# Remove all content before the configured string in the pull request body.
# This setting is useful when we want to include only a part of the pull request
# description as the commit message.
# This option only applies when `merge.message.body_type = "markdown"`.

[update]

# Update a PR whenever out of date with the base branch. The PR will be updated
# regardless of merge requirements (e.g. failing status checks, missing reviews,
# blacklist labels).
#
# Kodiak will only update PRs with the `merge.automerge_label` label or if
# `update.require_automerge_label = false`.
#
# When enabled, _Kodiak will not be able to efficiently update PRs._ If you have
# multiple PRs against a target like `master`, any time a commit is added to
# `master` _all_ of those PRs against `master` will update. For `N` PRs against
# a target you will see at least `N(N-1)/2` updates. If this configuration
# option was disabled you would only see at least `N-1` updates.
always = false # default: false

# When enabled, Kodiak will only update PRs that have an automerge label
# (configured via `merge.automerge_label`). When disable, Kodiak will update any
# PR. This option only applies when `update.always = true`.
