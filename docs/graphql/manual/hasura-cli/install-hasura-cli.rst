Install a binary globally
-------------------------

.. rst-class:: api_tabs
.. tabs::

  .. tab:: Linux

    In your Linux shell, run the following command:

    .. code-block:: bash

      curl -L https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/raw/stable/cli/get.sh | bash

    This will install the Hasura CLI in ``/usr/local/bin``. You might have to provide
    your ``sudo`` password depending on the permissions of your ``/usr/local/bin`` location.

    If you'd prefer to install to a different location other than ``/usr/local/bin``, set the
    env var ``INSTALL_PATH``:

    .. code-block:: bash

      curl -L https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/raw/stable/cli/get.sh | INSTALL_PATH=$HOME/bin bash

  .. tab:: Mac

    In your Terminal, run the following command:

    .. code-block:: bash

      curl -L https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/raw/stable/cli/get.sh | bash

    This will install the Hasura CLI in ``/usr/local/bin``. You might have to provide
    your ``sudo`` password depending on the permissions of your ``/usr/local/bin`` location.

    If you'd prefer to install to a different location other than ``/usr/local/bin``, set the
    env var ``INSTALL_PATH``:

    .. code-block:: bash

      curl -L https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/raw/stable/cli/get.sh | INSTALL_PATH=$HOME/bin bash

  .. tab:: Windows

    Download the binary ``cli-hasura-windows-amd64.exe`` available under ``Assets`` of the latest release
    from the GitHub release page: https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/releases

    Rename the downloaded file to ``hasura``. 
    You can add the path to the environment variable ``PATH`` for making ``hasura`` accessible globally.

Install through npm
-------------------

Hasura CLI is available as an npm package that is independently maintained by some members of the community.
It can be beneficial to use the npm package if you want a version-fixed cli dedicated to your node.js project.
You can find usage details (e.g. flag information) in  the `original repository <https://github.com/jjangga0214/hasura-cli>`__.

.. code-block:: bash
   
   # install as a devDependency of your project
   npm install --save-dev hasura-cli[@tag|@version]
   
   # or install globally on your system
   npm install --global hasura-cli[@tag|@version]

(Optional) Add shell completion
-------------------------------

To add command auto completion in the shell, refer to :ref:`hasura completion <hasura_completion>`.
