# Remote relationships

## Introduction

Remote relationships (aka "remote joins") allow you to join data across
remote schemas and other remote data sources. The remote data source can either be another
[remote schema](/graphql/core/remote-schemas/index.mdx) or a table from a database source.
Once you create relationships between types from your remote schema and types created
from databases or other remote schemas, you can then "join" them by running GraphQL
queries.

See the following guides on how to create different types of remote
relationships related to remote schemas:

- [Remote Schema to database relationships](/graphql/core/remote-schemas/remote-relationships/remote-schema-db-relationships.mdx): To join
data from your remote schemas (such as Stripe, Spotify or Auth0) to customer data from your tables.
- [Remote Schema to Remote Schema relationships](/graphql/core/remote-schemas/remote-relationships/remote-schema-relationships.mdx): To
join data between two remote schemas such as Stripe, Spotify or Auth0 to customer data from your custom GraphQL API.
- [Database to Remote Schema relationships](/graphql/core/databases/postgres/schema/remote-relationships/remote-schema-relationships.mdx): To
join data across tables and remote GraphQL APIs. For example, you can join customer data from your tables with account data from Stripe, Spotify, or Auth0.

## Benefits

Hasura's remote joins architecture provides the following benefits.


- **Security**: Hasura's [authorization model](/graphql/core/auth/authorization/index.mdx) gives
  you role-based access control. This extends to actions and remote
  schemas as well. In actions, you can go to the `Permissions` tab and
  choose which fields to expose for which roles. For remote schemas,
  Hasura will [forward your session variables](/graphql/core/remote-schemas/auth/index.mdx)
  which can be used to implement custom authorization in your remote
  schemas. Native role-based permissions on remote schemas is in the
  works.
- **Performance**: Hasura strives for optimal performance. It creates
  an efficient execution plan which pushes down most of the
  heavy-lifting involved to underlying sources. For example, Hasura
  creates a single efficient query to your database and batches calls
  to remote schemas to avoid the [n+1
  problem](https://hasura.io/learn/graphql/intro-graphql/graphql-server/)
  . More improvements to performance are upcoming.
- **Schema integrity & consistency**: Hasura has metadata consistency
  checks at every level. Whenever you add a table, remote schema, or
  action, Hasura makes sure that the graph that is exposed is
  consistent, and that all the relationships make sense at a type
  level. This helps you in creating robust workflows to test changes
  in your CI and making safe deployments of your unified graph.
- **Data federation**: With remote joins, the join, authorization, and
  consistency checks of added sources all happen at the Hasura layer
  via metadata. This allows underlying data sources and APIs to evolve
  independently. Your applications have a unified API to query the
  full data landscape in your org.
