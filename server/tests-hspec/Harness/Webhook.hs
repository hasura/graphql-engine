-- | This function starts a new thread with a minimal server on the
-- first available port. It returns the corresponding 'Server'.
--
-- This new server serves the following routes:
--   - GET on @/@, which returns a simple 200 OK;
--   - POST on @/echo@, which extracts the event data from the body
--     of the request and inserts it into the `EventsQueue`.
--
-- This function performs a health check, using a GET on /, to ensure that the
-- server was started correctly, and will throw an exception if the health check
-- fails. This function does NOT attempt to kill the thread in such a case,
-- which might result in a leak if the thread is still running but the server
-- fails its health check.
