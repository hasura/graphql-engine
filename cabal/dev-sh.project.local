-- By default GHC is dynamically linked, so to run TemplateHaskell you need dynamic versions of
-- libraries. But, also by default, cabal links executables statically, which requires static
-- versions of the libraries. Therefore, by default, cabal builds with -dynamic-too to generate
-- static and dynamic versions of all object files.
-- Setting executable-dynamic: True forces cabal to build a dynamic executable; but it's not
-- enough on its own: since library-vanilla defaults to True, cabal would still build a static
-- library. With those two flags together, we can finally only build one version of the library,
-- which substentially improves compilation time.
