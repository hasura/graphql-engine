# Action handlers

## Introduction

Actions need to be backed by custom business logic. This business logic
can be defined in a handler which is an HTTP webhook.

## HTTP handler

When the action is executed i.e. when the query or the mutation is
called, Hasura makes a `POST` request to the handler with the action
arguments and the session variables.

The request payload is of the format:

```json
{
  "action": {
    "name": "<action-name>"
  },
  "input": {
    "arg1": "<value>",
    "arg2": "<value>"
  },
  "session_variables": {
    "x-hasura-user-id": "<session-user-id>",
    "x-hasura-role": "<session-user-role>"
  },
  "request_query": "<request-query>"
}
```

:::info Note

All `session_variables` in the request payload have lowercase keys.

:::

## Returning a success response

To return a success response, you must send back a response payload of
action's response type. The HTTP status code must be `2xx` for a
successful response.

## Returning an error response

To return an error response, you must send back an error object. An
error object looks like:

```json
{
  "message": "<mandatory-error-message>",
  "extensions": "<optional-json-object>"
}
```

where `extensions` is an optional JSON value.

If present, `extensions` should be a JSON object, which may have a
status code field `code`, along with other data you may want to add to
your errors:

```json
{
  "code": "<optional-error-code>",
  "optionalField1": "<custom-data-here>"
}
```

The HTTP status code must be `4xx` in order to indicate an error
response.

For backwards compatibility with previous versions of Hasura, the `code`
field may also be supplied at the root of the error object, i.e. at
`$.code`. This will be deprecated in a future release, and providing
`code` within `extensions` is preferred.

## Example

For example, consider the following mutation.

```graphql
extend type Mutation {
  UserLogin (username: String!, password: String!): UserInfo
}

type UserInfo {
  accessToken: String!
  userId: Int!
}
```

Let's say, the following mutation is executed:

```graphql
mutation {
  UserLogin (username: "jake", password: "secretpassword") {
    accessToken
    userId
  }
}
```

Hasura will call the handler with the following payload:

```json
{
  "action": {
    "name": "UserLogin"
  },  
  "input": {
    "username": "jake",
    "password": "secretpassword"
  },
  "session_variables": {
    "x-hasura-user-id": "423",
    "x-hasura-role": "user"
  },
  "request_query": "mutation {\n  UserLogin (username: \"jake\", password: \"secretpassword\") {\n    accessToken\n    userId\n  }\n}\n"
}
```

To return a success response, you must send the response of the action's
output type (in this case, `UserInfo`) with a status code `2xx`. So a
sample response would be:

```json
{
  "accessToken": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVC",
  "userId": 423
}
```

To throw an error, you must send a response of the following type while
setting the status code as `4xx`.

```json
{
  "message": "invalid credentials"
}
```

## Restrict access to your action handler {#securing-action-handlers}

You might want to restrict access to your action handler in order to
ensure that it can only get called by your Hasura instance and not by
third parties.

### Adding an action secret

One possible way of restricting access to an action handler is by adding
a header to the action that is automatically sent with each request to
the webhook, and then adding a check against that in your action
handler.

- [Step 1: Configure your Hasura instance](/graphql/core/actions/action-handlers.mdx#configure-your-hasura-instance)
- [Step 2: Add a header to your action](/graphql/core/actions/action-handlers.mdx#add-a-header-to-your-action)
- [Step 3: Verify the secret in your action handler](/graphql/core/actions/action-handlers.mdx#verify-the-secret-in-your-action-handler)

:::info Note

Adding an action secret is a simple way of restricting access to an
action handler and will suffice in most use cases. However, if you have
more profound security requirements, you might want to choose advanced
security solutions tailored to your needs.

:::

#### Step 1: Configure your Hasura instance {#configure-your-hasura-instance}

In your Hasura server, add the action secret as an environment variable,
say `ACTION_SECRET_ENV`.

#### Step 2: Add a header to your action {#add-a-header-to-your-action}

For your action, add a header that will act as an action secret.

<Tabs className="api-tabs">
<TabItem value="console" label="Console">

Head to the `Actions -> [action-name]` tab in the console and scroll
down to `Headers`. You can now configure an action secret by adding a
header:

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/graphql/core/actions/action-secret-header.png"
  alt="Console action secret"
  width="700px"
/>

Then hit `Save`.
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

Go to `metadata/actions.yaml` in the Hasura project directory.

Update the definition of your action by adding the action secret as a
header:

```yaml {7-9}
- actions
  - name: actionName
    definition:
       kind: synchronous
       handler: http://localhost:3000
       forward_client_headers: true
       headers:
         - name: ACTION_SECRET
           value_from_env: ACTION_SECRET_ENV
```

Save the changes and run `hasura metadata apply` to set the headers.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="api" label="API">

Headers can be set when [creating](/graphql/core/api-reference/metadata-api/actions.mdx#metadata-create-action) or
[updating](/graphql/core/api-reference/metadata-api/actions.mdx#metadata-update-action) an action via the metadata API.

```http  {12-17}
POST /v1/metadata HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
X-Hasura-Role: admin

{
  "type": "create_action",
  "args": {
    "name": "addNumbers",
    "definition": {
      "kind": "synchronous",
      "type": "query",
      "headers": [
        {
          "name": "ACTION_SECRET",
          "value_from_env": "ACTION_SECRET_ENV"
        }
      ],
      "arguments": [
        {
          "name": "numbers",
          "type": "[Int]!"
        }
      ],
      "output_type": "AddResult",
      "handler": "https://hasura-actions-demo.glitch.me/addNumbers"
    }
  }
}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info Note

Before creating an action via the [create_action metadata API](/graphql/core/api-reference/metadata-api/actions.mdx#metadata-create-action), all custom types
need to be defined via the [set_custom_types](/graphql/core/api-reference/metadata-api/custom-types.mdx#metadata-set-custom-types) metadata API.

:::

This secret is only known by Hasura and is passed to your endpoint with
every call, thus making sure only Hasura can successfully authenticate
with the action handler.

:::info Note

The name for the action secret is not defined by Hasura and can be
chosen freely.

:::

#### Step 3: Verify the secret in your action handler {#verify-the-secret-in-your-action-handler}

First, load the action secret as an environment variable in your action
handler by adding it to your `.env` file (this file might be a different
one depending on your framework).

Second, you need to write some code in your action handler to check that
the action secret passed as a header equals to the one you stored as an
environment variable.

The following is an example of a simple authorization middleware with
Express which can be included before the request handler logic:

```javascript
// use authorization for all routes
app.use(authorizationMiddleware);

// authorize action call
function authorizationMiddleware(req, res, next){
    if (correctSecretProvided(req)) next();
    else res.sendStatus(403);
}

// check if the secret sent in the header equals to the secret stored as an env variable
function correctSecretProvided(req) {
    const requiredSecret = process.env.ACTION_SECRET_ENV;
    const providedSecret = req.headers['ACTION_SECRET'];
    return requiredSecret === providedSecret;
}

// Request handler
app.post('/actionHandler', async (req, res) => {
  // handler logic
});
```
