# MS SQL Server: Nested object queries

## Introduction

You can use the object (one-to-one) or array (one-to-many)
[relationships](/graphql/core/databases/ms-sql-server/schema/table-relationships/index.mdx) defined in your
schema to make a nested query i.e. fetch data for a type along with data
from a nested or related type.

The **name of the nested object** is the same as the name of the
object/array relationship configured in the console.

You can also filter, sort, aggregate and paginate nested objects in case
of array relationships. These are not exposed for object relationships
as they have only one nested object.

## Fetch nested object using an object relationship

The following is an example of a nested object query using the **object
relationship** between an article and an author.

**Example:** Fetch a list of articles and the name of each article’s
author:

<GraphiQLIDE
  query={`query {
      articles {
        id
        title
        author {
          name
        }
      }
    }`}
  response={`{
  "data": {
    "articles": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "title": "sit amet",
        "author": {
          "name": "Anjela"
        }
      },
      {
        "id": 2,
        "title": "a nibh",
        "author": {
          "name": "Beltran"
        }
      },
      {
        "id": 3,
        "title": "amet justo morbi",
        "author": {
          "name": "Anjela"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}`}
/>

## Fetch nested objects using an array relationship

The following is an example of a nested object query using the **array
relationship** between an author and articles.

**Example:** Fetch a list of authors and a nested list of each author’s
articles:

<GraphiQLIDE
  query={`query {
  authors {
    id
    name
    articles {
      id
      title
    }
  }
}`}
  response={`{
  "data": {
    "authors": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Justin",
        "articles": [
          {
            "id": 15,
            "title": "vel dapibus at"
          },
          {
            "id": 16,
            "title": "sem duis aliquam"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "id": 2,
        "name": "Beltran",
        "articles": [
          {
            "id": 2,
            "title": "a nibh"
          },
          {
            "id": 9,
            "title": "sit amet"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "id": 3,
        "name": "Sidney",
        "articles": [
          {
            "id": 6,
            "title": "sapien ut"
          },
          {
            "id": 11,
            "title": "turpis eget"
          },
          {
            "id": 14,
            "title": "congue etiam justo"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}`}
/>

:::info Note

You can also [filter](/graphql/core/databases/ms-sql-server/queries/query-filters.mdx#ms-sql-server-nested-filter),
[sort](/graphql/core/databases/ms-sql-server/queries/sorting.mdx#ms-sql-server-nested-sort),
[aggregate](/graphql/core/databases/ms-sql-server/queries/aggregation-queries.mdx#ms-sql-server-nested-aggregate) and
[paginate](/graphql/core/databases/ms-sql-server/queries/pagination.mdx#ms-sql-server-nested-paginate) nested objects in case of
array relationships.
