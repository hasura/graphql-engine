# General Style Points

- Try to include a `TL;DR` block for feature documentation at the top of the doc to summarise it as much as possible.
- Hasura features should be proper noun _title case_ to differentiate from any other uses of the word Eg: Console,
  Metadata, Migrations, Actions, Events, etc.
- Keep in mind you are trying to write for beginner, intermediate and advanced users.
- All lines in markdown should break at **120 characters** for better readability in IDEs. 120 is useful because it
  still allows side-by-side editing on most screens and closely matches the line length of the final output page at max
  width.
- Add appropriate cross-links in content to assist users.
  - If you refer to some functionality that is documented in some other docs page, add a link to that page.
  - If you have a statement like "create a relationship between tables X and Y ...", make "create a relationship"
    a link to the `Create relationships` page.
- Try to make each section within a page self-sufficient. i.e. avoid structuring all pages as step-by-step guides unless
  it really is the intent. This ensures that we can refer to sections externally (from other docs pages, Console, etc.)
  and expect that the user will be able to follow the section without being lost on the context that was set in earlier
  sections of the page. Adding statements such as "As we have described in the above section ..." might help to set up
  the needed context.
