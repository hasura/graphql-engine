Broadly, you're going to build a clone of [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/examples/react/#/) UI. Additionally you will also build a online user list to learn how GraphQL subscriptions work.

The app features the following:

- Users can authenticate (functionality is already implemented with Auth0)
- Display and manage personal todos
- Display and collaborate on public todos
- Display online users
- Realtime updates on new public todos and online users list

This is how your final app will look like:
