# Connecting Hasura to an Aiven MySQL Database

## Introduction

This guide explains how to connect a new or existing [Aiven MySQL](https://aiven.io/mysql) database to a Hasura
instance, either on [Hasura Cloud](https://cloud.hasura.io?skip_onboarding=true) or via one of our
[self-hosted](/deployment/deployment-guides/index.mdx) solutions.

:::info Note

If you plan on using Hasura Cloud, which we recommend, follow steps 1 and 2 below. If you're self-hosting a Hasura
instance and already have a project running, skip to [step 3](#create-mysql-db-aiven).

:::

:::tip Supported From

Aiven-hosted MySQL databases are supported from Hasura `v2.35.0` onwards.

:::

## Step 1: Sign up or log in to Hasura Cloud

Navigate to [Hasura Cloud](https://cloud.hasura.io/signup/?pg=docs&plcmt=body&cta=navigate-to-hasura-cloud&tech=default)
and sign up or log in.

## Step 2: Create a Hasura Cloud project {#create-hasura-project-aiven}

On the Hasura Cloud dashboard, create a new project:

<Thumbnail src="/img/cloud-dbs/create-hasura-cloud-project.png" alt="Create Hasura Cloud project" width="1000px" />

After the project is initialized successfully, click on `Launch Console` to open the Hasura Console in your browser.

On the Hasura Console, navigate to the `Data` tab and choose `Connect Existing Database`. Choose the MySQL driver and
then click `Connect Existing Database`:

We'll provision the database on Aiven in the next step and then return to this page to complete the connection.

## Step 3: Create a MySQL DB on Aiven {#create-mysql-db-aiven}

:::info Note

If you have an existing Aiven MySQL database, you can skip this step and move on to [step 4](#connect-hasura-aiven).

:::

Log into the [Aiven console](https://console.aiven.io/login).

On the Aiven console, click `+ Create a new service` and choose `MySQL`:

<Thumbnail

  alt="Create MySQL instance on Aiven"
  width="1000px"
/>

Scroll down and select the `Cloud Provider`, `Region` and `Service Plan` based on your requirements. Then click
`Create free service`:

  alt="Configure MySQL service"
  width="1000px"
/>

## Step 4: Allow connections to your DB from Hasura {#connect-hasura-aiven}

On the `Services` dashboard, click on your DB and scroll down to `Allowed IP Addresses` and click on `Change`:

<Thumbnail

  alt="Change allowed IP addresses on Aiven"
  width="1000px"
/>

If you're using Hasura Cloud, you can quickly find your IP address from the `Hasura Cloud IP` field on the project's
details view:

:::info Note

If you're using a self-hosted solution, you'll need to determine the IP address manually depending on your hosting
service.

:::

Add the Hasura IP address that you copied, click on the `+`:

<Thumbnail src="/img/databases/mysql/aiven/aiven-mysql-hasura-cloud-ip-set.png" alt="Hasura Cloud IP" width="1000px" />

Then click on `Close`.

## Step 5: Get the database connection URL {#get-db-url-aiven}

The MySQL connector utilizes JDBC connection strings to connect to the database. The format of the connection string is
as follows:

```bash
jdbc:mysql://<hostname>:<port>/<database name>?user=<username>&password=<password>
```

You'll have to transform the connection string provided by Aiven into the format above. Navigate to the `Overview` tab
of your database dashboard and use the `Service URI` to construct the connection string:

<Thumbnail src="/img/databases/mysql/aiven/aiven-mysql-connection-uri.png" alt="Connection URI" width="1000px" />

## Step 6: Finish connecting the database

Back on the Hasura Console, enter the database URL that we retrieved in [step 5](#get-db-url-aiven):

<Thumbnail src="/img/databases/mysql/aiven/aiven-mysql-finish-connecting.png" alt="Finish connecting" width="1000px" />

Then click `Connect Database`.

:::info Note

For security reasons, it is recommended to set database URLs as [env vars](/hasura-cloud/projects/env-vars.mdx) and
using the env vars to connect to the databases in place of the raw database URLs.

:::

Voil√†. You are ready to start developing.

## Next steps

- You can check out our [30-Minute Hasura Basics Course](https://hasura.io/learn/graphql/hasura/introduction/) and other
  [GraphQL & Hasura Courses](https://hasura.io/learn/) for a more detailed introduction to Hasura.

- If using Hasura Cloud, you can also click the gear icon to manage your Hasura Cloud project. (e.g. add
  [collaborators](/hasura-cloud/projects/collaborators.mdx), [env vars](/hasura-cloud/projects/env-vars.mdx) or
  [custom domains](/hasura-cloud/domains.mdx)).
