# Hasura - CockroachDB Compatibility

## Introduction

As CockroachDB supports PostgreSQL, the way it functions with Hasura is also very similar. However, there are a few
incompatibilities to be aware of.

## Incompatibilities and unsupported features

The most up-to-date list of unsupported Postgres features can be found on the
[CockroachDB website](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/postgresql-compatibility.html).

- [Unsupported Postgres features](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/postgresql-compatibility.html#unsupported-features)
- [Features that differ from Postgres](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/postgresql-compatibility.html#features-that-differ-from-postgresql)

Currently, the following features are supported with CockroachDB and Hasura:

## Queries

Queries are fully supported except for queries containing `distinct_on` arguments, [see issue](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/90763), but please note that GraphQL key
ordering in JSON objects is not guaranteed. This is because CockroachDB implements the `JSONB` variant of the Postgres
JSON types, which do not preserve key ordering.

Please also note that SERIAL columns will produce numbers that overflow JavaScript numbers. These will need special
treatment by either enabling the
[`HASURA_GRAPHQL_STRINGIFY_NUMERIC_TYPES` environment variable](/deployment/graphql-engine-flags/reference.mdx) or
bespoke JSON parsing client-side.

## Tables

Querying from all kinds of tables and views is currently supported. This includes local, reference, and distributed
tables. All the tables can be tracked from the Hasura Console.

## Relationships

The following table describes the supported relationships based on the supported joins in CockroachDB:

|                      | To Local      | To Reference  | To Distributed |
| -------------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| **From Local**       | Object, Array | Object, Array |                |
| **From Reference**   | Object, Array | Object, Array |                |
| **From Distributed** |               | Object        | Object, Array  |

The Hasura Console allows you to add all the supported relationships.

## Permissions

All permissions work on CockroachDB like on Postgres without any restrictions.

## Functions

CockroachDB, and therefore Hasura, does not yet support user-defined functions (UDFs) on a stable release. However, UDF
support has recently been added to CockroachDB Beta
([see issue](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/58356)), so watch this space!

## Mutations

Mutations are supported in GraphQL Engine with the exception of fetching relationship data as part of `returning`. This
is not yet supported.

## Subscriptions

Subscriptions are currently not supported with CockroachDB. Support will be added in a future release.

## Event triggers

CockroachDB does not yet support creating triggers ([see issue](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/issues/28296))
on reference tables. Hence, this is currently not supported.

## Naming conventions

Naming conventions are currently only implemented as an experimental feature on Postgres sources.
[See docs](/schema/postgres/naming-convention.mdx).
