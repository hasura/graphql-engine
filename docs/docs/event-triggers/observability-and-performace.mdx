The Hasura Event Triggers system can be segmented into the 2 parts:

### Event capture system

Event capture is accomplished via database triggers. A database trigger is created which is invoked whenever there is an
`INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE` (based on the definition of the event trigger) on the table.

The database trigger captures a per-row change and then writes that to a Hasura Events table. The Hasura Event tables
acts as a queue for all pending/in-process events.

### Event delivery system

Hasura creates a poller thread, which polls the Hasura Event tables for new/pending events. The poller thread fetches
the events in batches (by default 100) and adds them to its in-memory events queue (Hasura Events queue). The polling is
paused if all the HTTP workers (defined below) are busy.

Hasura also creates a pool of HTTP workers (by default 100) which are responsible for delivering the events from the
events queue to the webhook.

## Observability

<ProductBadge self />

Hasura exposes a set of [Prometheus metrics](/enterprise/metrics.mdx) that can be used to monitor the Event Trigger
system and help diagnose performance issues.

### Event fetch time per batch

Hasura fetches the events in batches (by default 100) from the Hasura Event tables in the database. This metric
represents the time taken to fetch a batch of events from the database.

A higher metric indicates slower polling of events from the database, you should consider looking into the performance
of your database.

### Event invocations total

This metric represents the number of HTTP requests that have been made to the webhook server for delivering events.

|        |                                                            |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Name   | `hasura_event_invocations_total`                           |
| Type   | Counter                                                    |
| Labels | `status`: success \| failed, `trigger_name`, `source_name` |

### Event processed total

Total number of events processed. Represents the Event Trigger egress.

|        |                                                            |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Name   | `hasura_event_processed_total`                             |
| Type   | Counter                                                    |
| Labels | `status`: success \| failed, `trigger_name`, `source_name` |

### Event processing time

Time time taken for an event to be processed.

|        |                                                                       |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Name   | `hasura_event_processing_time_seconds`                                |
| Type   | Histogram<br /><br />Buckets: 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10, 30, 100 |
| Labels | `trigger_name`, `source_name`                                         |

The processing of an event involves the following steps:

1.  Hasura Engine fetching the event from Hasura Event tables in the database and adding it to the Hasura Events queue
2.  An HTTP worker picking up the event from the Hasura Events queue
3.  An HTTP worker delivering the event to the webhook

:::info Event delivery failure

Note, if the delivery of the event fails - the delivery of the event is retried based on its `next_retry_at`
configuration.

:::

This metric represent the time taken for an event to be delivered since it was created (if the first attempt) or retried
(after the first attempt). **This metric can be considered as the end-to-end processing time for an event.**

For e.g., say an event was created at `2021-01-01 10:00:30` and it has a `next_retry_at` configuration which says if the
event delivery fails, the event should be retried after 30 seconds.

At `2021-01-01 10:01:30`: the event was fetched from the Hasura Event tables, picked up by the HTTP worker, and the
delivery was attempted. The delivery failed and the `next_retry_at` of `2021-01-01 10:02:00` was set for the event.

Now at `2021-01-01 10:02:00`: the event was fetched again from the Hasura Event tables, picked up by the HTTP worker,
and the delivery was attempted at `2021-01-01 10:03: 30`. This time, the delivery was successful.

The processing time for the second delivery try would be:

Processing Time = event delivery time - event next retried time

Processing Time = `2021-01-01 10:03:30` - `2021-01-01 10:02:00` = `90 seconds`

### Event queue time

Hasura fetches the events from the Hasura Event tables in the database and adds it to the Hasura Events queue. The event
queue time represents the time taken for an event to be picked up by the HTTP worker after it has been added to the
"Events Queue".

Higher value of this metric implies slow event processing. In this case, you can consider increasing the
[HTTP pool size](/deployment/graphql-engine-flags/reference.mdx/#events-http-pool-size) or optimizing the webhook
server.

|        |                                                                       |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Name   | `hasura_event_queue_time_seconds`                                     |
| Type   | Histogram<br /><br />Buckets: 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10, 30, 100 |
| Labels | `trigger_name`, `source_name`                                         |

### Event Triggers HTTP Workers

Current number of active Event Trigger HTTP workers. Compare this number to the
[HTTP pool size](/deployment/graphql-engine-flags/reference.mdx/#events-http-pool-size). Consider increasing it if the
metric is near the current configured value.

|        |                                     |
| ------ | ----------------------------------- |
| Name   | `hasura_event_trigger_http_workers` |
| Type   | Gauge                               |
| Labels | none                                |

### Event webhook processing time

The time between when an HTTP worker picks an event for delivery to the time it sends the event payload to the webhook.

A higher processing time indicates slow webhook, you should try to optimize the event webhook.

|        |                                                              |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Name   | `hasura_event_webhook_processing_time_seconds`               |
| Type   | Histogram<br /><br />Buckets: 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10 |
| Labels | `trigger_name`, `source_name`                                |

### Events fetched per batch

Number of events fetched from the Hasura Event tables in the database per batch. This number should be equal or less
than the [events fetch batch size](/deployment/graphql-engine-flags/reference.mdx/#events-fetch-batch-size).

|        |                                   |
| ------ | --------------------------------- |
| Name   | `hasura_events_fetched_per_batch` |
| Type   | Gauge                             |
| Labels | none                              |

Since polling the database to continuously check if there are any pending events is an expensive operation, Hasura only
polls the database if there are any pending events. This metric can be used to understand if there are any pending
events in the Hasura Event Tables.

:::info Dependent on pending events

Note that Hasura only fetches events from the Hasura Event tables if there are any pending events. If there are no
pending events, this metric will be 0.

## Golden signals for Hasura Event Triggers

You can perform
[Golden Signals-based](https://sre.google/sre-book/monitoring-distributed-systems/#xref_monitoring_golden-signals)
system monitoring with Hasura's exported metrics. The following are the golden signals for analyzing Hasura Event
Triggers system performance.

### Latency

Latency for the Hasura Event Triggers system references the total time taken by the graphql engine in delivering the
events. To monitor the latency, you can use the [`hasura_event_processing_time_seconds`](#event-processing-time) metric.

If the value of this metric is high, it maybe an indication that events are taking longer time to be processed and
delivered.

The following are few things you can do to analyze and diagnose the latency issue:

1.  **Investigate DB performance**: Check the value of the
    [`hasura_event_fetch_time_per_batch_seconds`](#event-fetch-time-per-batch) metric. If the value of this metric is
    high, it maybe an indication that the database is slow. Consider optimizing the database.
2.  **Investigate HTTP Worker Saturation**: Check the value of the
    [`hasura_event_queue_time_seconds`](#event-queue-time) metric. If the value of this metric is high, it maybe an
    indication that all the HTTP workers are saturated and are not able to pick up the events from the `Events Queue`.
    Consider increasing the
    [Events HTTP Pool Size](/deployment/graphql-engine-flags/reference.mdx/#events-http-pool-size)
3.  **Investigate Webhook Performance**: Check the value of the
    [`hasura_event_webhook_processing_time_seconds`](#event-webhook-processing-time) metric. If the value of this metric
    is high, it maybe an indication that the webhook is slow. Consider optimizing the webhook.

You can also try [scaling](/latest/faq/index/#faq-scaling) your Hasura instance horizontally to handle more events.

### Saturation

Saturation is the threshold until which the Hasura Event Triggers system can run smoothly. Once this threshold is
crossed, you may see performance issues such as high event processing time, etc.

Saturation for the Event Trigger system references the difference between the incoming events rate and event delivery
rate.

```
Saturation =  No. of active HTTP workers / No. of total HTTP workers
```

To monitor saturation, you can use the following:

1.  **Investigate HTTP Workers**: Compare the active HTTP workers
    [`hasura_event_trigger_http_workers`](#event-triggers-http-workers) with the
    [Events HTTP Pool Size](/deployment/graphql-engine-flags/reference.mdx/#events-http-pool-size). Saturation is high
    if the active HTTP workers is near the HTTP pool size. If HTTP workers are saturated then it maybe also indicate
    that the `hasura_event_queue_time_seconds` is also high. Consider Increasing the number of HTTP workers by
    increasing the [Events HTTP Pool Size](/deployment/graphql-engine-flags/reference.mdx/#events-http-pool-size)

### Traffic

Traffic for Event Triggers means the number of new events created at a given point of time. Since it's complicated to
figure out the number of events created, you can use the number of Event Triggers processed as a proxy for traffic.

To monitor traffic, you can use the [`hasura_event_processed_total`](#event-processed-total) metric.

If the value of this metric is high (and above your established baseline), and the Hasura Event Triggers system is also
saturated (`hasura_event_trigger_http_workers` nearing the configured HTTP worker pool size and
`hasura_event_queue_time_seconds` is also high), then you may want to consider doing the following:

1.  Increasing the number of HTTP workers by increasing the
    [Events HTTP Pool Size](/deployment/graphql-engine-flags/reference.mdx/#events-http-pool-size)
2.  [Scaling](/latest/faq/index/#faq-scaling) your Hasura instance horizontally to handle more events.

### Errors

Errors for an Event Trigger references the number of event deliveries that failed or errored out.

To monitor errors, you can use the [`hasura_event_processed_total`](#event-processed-total) metric. You can then filter
the metric using the label `status: failed` i.e., `hasura_event_processed_total{status="failure"}`.

You can do to the following to analyze and diagnose errors:

1.  Identify the Event Trigger with a high error rate. You can do this by using the above metric and see the trigger
    name associated to that metric in the `trigger_name` label.
2.  You can then use the
    [`*_get_event_logs`](/api-reference/metadata-api/event-triggers.mdx/#metadata-pg-get-event-logs) and
    [`*_get_event_invocation_logs`](/api-reference/metadata-api/event-triggers.mdx/#metadata-pg-get-event-invocation-logs)
    metadata API to get the error logs for the Event Trigger. This should provide some insights into the error.

## Tuning Hasura Event Triggers performance

Hasura Event Triggers are designed to handle of millions of events per hour. However, due to misconfigurations or other
reasons, the performance of the Hasura Event Triggers system can be impacted. This section describes how to tune the
performance of subscriptions.

### Performance tuning

Event Trigger processing can be tuned by few server settings as described below:

- [`HASURA_GRAPHQL_EVENTS_FETCH_BATCH_SIZE`](/deployment/graphql-engine-flags/reference.mdx/#events-fetch-batch-size):
  - The number of events fetched from the `Hasura Event tables` in the database per batch. By default, 100.
  - Increasing this will fetch more events from the database per batch, thereby reducing the load on database and
    improving throughput while increasing individual fetch SQL execution times and, potentially, the memory of the
    Hasura instance.
- [`HASURA_GRAPHQL_EVENTS_HTTP_POOL_SIZE`](/deployment/graphql-engine-flags/reference.mdx/#events-http-pool-size):
  - The maximum number of HTTP workers that are spawned to deliver events to the webhook. By default, 100.
  - Increasing this will spawn more HTTP workers, thereby increasing the number of concurrent event deliveries to the
    webhook. This may also increase the memory and the CPU usage of the Hasura instance.
- [`HASURA_GRAPHQL_EVENTS_FETCH_INTERVAL`](/deployment/graphql-engine-flags/reference.mdx/#events-fetch-interval):
  - The interval at which Hasura polls the database for new events. By default, 1 second.
  - Increasing this reduces frequency of the poll to the database reducing the load on it while increasing the latency
    of processing of event.
