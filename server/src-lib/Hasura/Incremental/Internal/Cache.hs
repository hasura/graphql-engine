  -- | Adds equality-based caching to the given arrow. After each execution of the arrow, its input
  -- and result values are cached. On the next execution, the new input value is compared via '=='
  -- to the previous input value. If they are the same, the previous result is returned /without/
  -- re-executing the arrow. Otherwise, the old cached values are discarded, and the arrow is
  -- re-executed to produce a new set of cached values.
  --
  -- Indescriminate use of 'cache' is likely to have little effect except to increase memory usage,
  -- since the input and result of each execution must be retained in memory. Avoid using 'cache'
  -- around arrows with large input or output that is likely to change often unless profiling
  -- indicates it is computationally expensive enough to be worth the memory overhead.
  --
  -- __Note that only direct inputs and outputs of the given arrow are cached.__ If an arrow
  -- provides access to values through a side-channel, they will __not__ participate in caching.
