In this part of the tutorial, you will learn how to mark an existing todo as completed by using GraphQL Mutations.

Let's define a graphql query to do a mutation into todos.

```graphql
  mutation toggleTodo ($id: Int!, $isCompleted: Boolean!) {
    update_todos(where: {id: {_eq: $id}}, _set: {is_completed: $isCompleted}) {
      affected_rows
    }
  }
```
You will also need to pass in the values for the variables.

[Try](https://learn.hasura.io/graphql/graphiql) this mutation in GraphiQL against the application database to see what the response looks like.

Let's now integrate this graphql mutation into our angular app.
