# Getting Started

## Introduction

To use the Hasura GraphQL engine, you need to:

- Deploy the Hasura GraphQL engine, with access to a Postgres database
  to store its metadata.
- Connect new/existing database(s) and set up and test your GraphQL
  API using the Hasura console UI _(also possible via CLI or API)_.
- Consume the generated GraphQL API from your client apps.

## Quickstart guides

- [Using Hasura Cloud](/graphql/cloud/getting-started/index.mdx) - Create a new Hasura
  Cloud project with just a few clicks.
  - Recommended as it's **the fastest way** to try Hasura GraphQL engine out.
  - Comes with **extra features for reliability and security** and a managed metadata database.

Hasura is open-source and can also be downloaded locally.
[Set up Hasura GraphQL engine using Docker Compose](/graphql/core/getting-started/docker-simple.mdx).
This is recommended if you want to **run Hasura locally** or if your
database cannot be exposed to Hasura Cloud.

<!-- TODO: add link to detailed deployment guides post 2.0 content update -->
