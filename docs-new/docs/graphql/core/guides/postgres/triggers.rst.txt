## Introduction

[Postgres
triggers](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createtrigger.html)
are used to invoke previously defined Postgres functions *before* or
*after* a specific database event (e.g. `INSERT`) occurs.

For more information on Postgres triggers, please refer to the [Postgres
documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createtrigger.html).

## Examples

**Trigger a Postgres function before an article is inserted or
updated:**

Let's say we want to check if an author is active before a corresponding
article can be inserted or updated. We can do so with the following
Postgres function:

```plpgsql
CREATE FUNCTION check_author_active()
    RETURNS trigger AS $BODY$
    DECLARE active_author BOOLEAN;
    BEGIN
    SELECT author.is_active INTO active_author FROM "authors" author WHERE author.id = NEW."author_id";
    IF active_author != TRUE THEN
        RAISE EXCEPTION 'Author must be active';
    END IF;
    RETURN NEW;
    END;
    $BODY$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

Now we want to have this function executed whenever a new article is
about to be inserted or updated. We can create a Postgres trigger as
follows:

```plpgsql
CREATE TRIGGER insert_article BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE ON "articles" FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE PROCEDURE check_author_active();
```

If someone now tries to insert an article for an author that is not
active, the following error will be thrown:

```plpgsql
unexpected : Author must be active
```

**Refresh a materialized view when an author gets inserted:**

Let's say we want to refresh a materialized view whenever a new author
is inserted.

The following Postgres function refreshes a materialized view:

```plpgsql
CREATE FUNCTION refresh_materialized_view()
  RETURNS trigger AS $BODY$
  BEGIN
  REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW popular_active_authors;
  RETURN NULL;
  END;
  $BODY$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

Now, to make sure this function gets called whenever a new author is
inserted, we can create the following Postgres trigger:

```plpgsql
CREATE TRIGGER update_materialized_view AFTER INSERT ON "authors" FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE PROCEDURE refresh_materialized_view();
```

## Postgres triggers & Hasura

Postgres triggers can be used to perform business logic such as data
validation and can be added
`as described here <pg_data_validations_pg_triggers>`.

Hasura also has `event triggers <event_triggers>` that can be used to
invoke external HTTP APIs for executing custom business logic on
database events.
