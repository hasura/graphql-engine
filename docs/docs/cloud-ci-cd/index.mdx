# Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment with Hasura Cloud

<ProductBadge free pro ee />

## Introduction

Hasura Cloud also enables automatically creating Preview Apps with Migrations and Metadata from a branch on a GitHub
repo by triggering a new deployment. These features are intended to improve the CI/CD experience on Hasura Cloud.

## Hasura Cloud GitHub Integration

Hasura Cloud can automatically detect Metadata and Migration changes in a linked GitHub repo and deploy these changes to
the linked project. Read more on how to add this integration in your project
[here](/cloud-ci-cd/github-integration.mdx).

## Hasura Cloud Preview Apps

Hasura Cloud enables creating Preview Apps from a branch on GitHub. This allows you to spin up a Hasura Cloud Preview
App on each pull request in order to automatically preview changes.

This can be achieved using either of the following:

- [Preview App GitHub Action](/cloud-ci-cd/preview-apps.mdx#preview-apps-github-action)
- [Preview App APIs](/cloud-ci-cd/preview-apps.mdx#preview-apps-api)

:::info Note

This feature is currently in beta. Please reach out through our support channels with any questions or concerns.

:::info Usage Limit

For users with only `Free` tier projects on Hasura Cloud, usage of the Preview App API is limited to 60 calls per month.
More plans are coming soon.
