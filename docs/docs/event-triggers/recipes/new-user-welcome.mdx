# Send an Email when a User Signs Up

## Introduction

Using Event Triggers allows you to call a webhook with a contextual payload whenever a specific event occurs in your
database. In this recipe, we'll create an Event Trigger that will fire whenever a new user signs up. We'll then send a
welcome email to that user.

<SampleAppBlock dependent />

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure that you have the following in place:

- The docs e-commerce sample app deployed to Hasura Cloud.

:::info Tunneling your webhook endpoint from your local machine

If you plan on using a webhook endpoint hosted on your own machine, ensure that you have a tunneling service such as
[ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) set up so that your Cloud Project can communicate with your local machine.

:::

## Our model

Event Triggers are designed to run when specific operations occur on a table, such as insertions, updates, and
deletions. When architecting your own Event Trigger, you need to consider the following:

- Which table's changes will initiate the Event Trigger?
- Which operation(s) on that table will initiate the Event Trigger?
- What should my webhook do with the data it receives?

## Step 1: Create the Event Trigger

Head to the `Events` tab of the Hasura Console and click `Create`:

  alt="Click Create"

/>

## Step 2: Configure the Event Trigger

First, provide a name for your trigger, e.g., `new_user_welcome`. Choose the `public` schema and the `users` table.
Then, select the `insert` operation.

Finally, enter a webhook URL that will be called when the event is triggered. This webhook will be responsible for
parsing the body of the request and sending the email to the new user; it can be hosted anywhere, and written in any
language you like.

The route on our webhook we'll use is `/new-user`. Below, we'll see what this looks like with a service like
[ngrok](https://ngrok.com/), but the format will follow this template:

```text
https://<your-webhook-url>/new-user
```

:::info Tunneling your webhook endpoint

Since our project is running on Hasura Cloud, and our handler will run on our local machine, we'll use ngrok to expose
the webhook endpoint to the internet. This will allow us to expose a public URL that will forward requests to our local
machine and the server we'll configure below.

You'll need to modify your webhook URL to use the public URL provided by ngrok.

After installing ngrok and
[authenticating](https://ngrok.com/docs/secure-tunnels/ngrok-agent/tunnel-authtokens/#:~:text=Once%20you've%20signed%20up,make%20installing%20the%20authtoken%20simple.),
you can do this by running:

```bash
ngrok http 4000
```

Then, copy the `Forwarding` value for use in our webhook 🎉

:::

Under `Advanced Settings`, we can configure the headers that will be sent with the request. We'll add an
`authentication` header to prevent abuse of the endpoint and ensure that only Hasura can trigger the event. Set the
`Key` as `secret-authorization-string` and the `Value` as `super_secret_string_123`:

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/event-triggers/recipes/review-moderation/event-trigger-secret-header.png"
  alt="Add the secret header"
  width="1000px"
/>

Before exiting, open the `Add Request Options Transform` section and check `POST`. Then, click `Create Event Trigger`.

## Step 3: Create a webhook to handle the request

Whenever new data is inserted into our `users` table, the Event Trigger fires. Hasura will send a request to the webhook
URL you provided. In this example, we're simply going to send a `POST` request. Our webhook will parse the request,
ensure the header is correct, and then send a welcome email.

Event Triggers sent by Hasura to your webhook as a request include a [payload](/event-triggers/payload.mdx) with `event`
data nested inside the `body` object of the request. This `event` object can then be parsed and values extracted from it
to be used in your webhook.

Below, we've written an example of webhook. As we established earlier, this runs on port `4000`. If you're attempting to
run this locally, follow the instructions below. If you're running this in a hosted environment, use this code as a
guide to write your own webhook.

Init a new project with `npm init` and install the following dependencies:

```bash
npm install express body-parser nodemailer
```

<details>
<summary>
Then, create a new file called <code>index.js</code> and add the following code:
</summary>

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const nodemailer = require('nodemailer');

const app = express();
app.use(bodyParser.json());
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }));

// Create a Nodemailer transporter using Ethereal email service
// Ideally, this configuration would be stored somewhere else
nodemailer.createTestAccount((err, account) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error('Failed to create a testing account. ' + err.message);
    return process.exit(1);
  }

  // If all goes as planned, here's the console telling us we're 👍
  console.log('Credentials obtained, listening on the webhook...');

  // Create a transporter object for nodemailer
  const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
    host: 'smtp.ethereal.email',
    port: 587,
    secure: false,
    auth: {
      user: account.user,
      pass: account.pass,
    },
  });

  // Our route for the webhook
  app.post('/new-user', async (req, res) => {
    // confirm the auth header is correct — ideally, you'd keep the secret in an environment variable
    const authHeader = req.headers['secret-authorization-string'];
    if (authHeader !== 'super_secret_string_123') {
      return res.status(401).json({
        message: 'Unauthorized',
      });
    }

    // Get the user's name and email from the request body
    const name = req.body.event.data.new.name;
    const email = req.body.event.data.new.email;

    // Create the notification email
    const message = {
      from: 'SuperStore.com <sender@SuperStore.com>',
      to: `${name} <${email}>`,
      subject: `Welcome, ${name.split(' ')[0]}!`,
      text: `Hi ${name.split(' ')[0]},\n\nWe're glad to have you as a member!`,
    };

    // Send the message using the Nodemailer transporter
    const info = await transporter.sendMail(message);

    // Log the message info
    console.log(`\nWelcome email sent to ${name}: ${nodemailer.getTestMessageUrl(info)}`);

    // Return a JSON response to the client
    res.json({
      message: 'Welcome email sent!',
    });
  });

  // Start the server
  app.listen(4000, () => {
    console.log('Server started on port 4000');
  });
});
```

You can run the server by running `node index.js` in your terminal.

Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can use pip to install them:

```bash
pip install Flask secure-smtplib
```

<details>
<summary>
Then, create a new file called <code>index.py</code> and add the following code:
</summary>

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import smtplib
from smtplib import SMTPException
from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart
from email.mime.text import MIMEText

app = Flask(__name__)

# Create an SMTP server connection
def create_smtp_server():
    try:
        server = smtplib.SMTP(host='smtp.ethereal.email', port=587)
        server.starttls()
        server.login('example@superstore.com', 'samplePassword123')
        return server
    except SMTPException as e:
        print(f"An error occurred while creating the SMTP server: {e}\n\n🔔We'll print the message to the terminal:\n\n")
        return None

@app.route('/new-user', methods=['POST'])
def create_new_user():
    # Confirm the authentication header is correct
    auth_header = request.headers.get('secret-authorization-string')
    if auth_header != 'super_secret_string_123':
        return jsonify({'message': 'Unauthorized'}), 401

    # Get the user's name and email from the request body
    data = request.get_json()
    name = data['event']['data']['new']['name']
    email = data['event']['data']['new']['email']

    # Create the notification email
    # Create a message
    msg = MIMEMultipart()
    msg['From'] = 'sender@SuperStore.com'
    msg['To'] = f"{name} <{email}>"
    msg['Subject'] = f"Welcome, {name.split(' ')[0]}!"
    message_body = f"Hi {name.split(' ')[0]},\n\nWe're glad to have you as a member!"
    msg.attach(MIMEText(message_body, 'plain'))

    server = create_smtp_server()
    if server is not None:
        # Send the email if server is running
        server.sendmail('sender@SuperStore.com', email, msg.as_string())
        server.quit()
    else:
        # or just print the message to the terminal
        print(f"From: {msg['From']}\nTo: {msg['To']}\nSubject: {msg['Subject']}\n{message_body}")

    return jsonify({'message': 'Welcome email sent!'})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(port=4000)
```

</details>

You can run the server by running `python index.py` in your terminal.

If you see the message `Webhook server is running on port 4000`, you're good to go!

## Step 4: Test the setup

With your server running, Hasura should be able to hit the endpoint. We can test this by inserting a new row into our
`users` table. Let's do this with the following mutation from the `API` tab of the Console:

```graphql
mutation InsertUser {
  insert_users_one(object: { name: "<YOUR_NAME>", email: "YOUR_EMAIL" }) {
    id
  }
}
```

We'll then see our server send the welcome email 🎉

Feel free to customize the webhook implementation based on your specific requirements. Remember to handle error
scenarios, implement necessary validations, and add appropriate security measures to your webhook endpoint.
