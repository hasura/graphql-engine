# gatsby-gitbook-starter

Kick off your project with this starter to create a powerful/flexible docs/tutorial web apps.

![gatsby-gitbook-starter](https://graphql-engine-cdn.hasura.io/learn-hasura/gatsby-gitbook-starter/assets/documentation_app_blog.png)

## Motivation

We wanted to create a [GraphQL tutorial](https://learn.hasura.io) series. The content would be written by developers for various languages/frameworks and what better than writing it in Markdown! And since this is a tutorial series we also needed rich embeds, syntax highlighting and more customisations.

We also wanted to serve these tutorials in sub paths of [learn.hasura.io](https://learn.hasura.io). To serve all these requirements, we decided to use Gatsby + MDX (Markdown + JSX) to extend markdown and used a neat consistent theme like the one at [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com) and deployed as docker containers.

## 🔥 Features
- Write using Markdown / [MDX](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx)
- GitBook style theme
- Syntax Highlighting using Prism [`Bonus`: Code diff highlighting]
- Google Analytics Integration
- Automatically generated sidebar navigation, table of contents, previous/next
- Edit on Github
- Fully customisable
- Rich embeds and live code editor using MDX
- Easy deployment: Deploy on Netlify / Now.sh / Docker

## 🔗 Live Demo

Here's a [live demo](https://learn.hasura.io/graphql/react)

## 🚀 Quickstart

Get started by running the following commands:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:hasura/gatsby-gitbook-starter.git
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Visit `http://localhost:8000/` to view the app.

## 🔧 Configure

Write markdown files in `content` folder.

Open `config.js` for templating variables. Broadly configuration is available for `gatsby`, `header`, `sidebar` and `siteMetadata`.

- `gatsby` config for global configuration like 
    - `pathPrefix` - Gatsby Path Prefix
    - `siteUrl` - Gatsby Site URL
    - `gaTrackingId` - Google Analytics Tracking ID

- `header` config for site header configuration like
    - `title` - The title that appears on the top left
    - `githubUrl` - The Github URL for the docs website
    - `helpUrl` - Help URL for pointing to resources
    - `tweetText` - Tweet text
    - `links` - Links on the top right

- `sidebar` config for navigation links configuration
    - `forcedNavOrder` for left sidebar navigation order. It should be in the format "/<filename>"
    - `links` - Links on the bottom left of the sidebar

- `siteMetadata` config for website related configuration
    - `title` - Title of the website
    - `description` - Description of the website
    - `ogImage` - Social Media share og:image tag
    - `docsLocation` - The Github URL for Edit on Github

- For sub nesting in left sidebar, create a folder with the same name as the top level `.md` filename and the sub navigation is auto-generated. Currently it supports only one level of nesting. The sub navigation is alphabetically ordered.

## Live Code Editor

To render react components for live editing, add the `react-live=true` to the code section. For example:

```javascript react-live=true
<button>Edit my text</button>
```

In the above code, just add `javascript react-live=true` after the triple quote ``` to start rendering react components that can be edited by users.

## 🤖 SEO friendly

This is a static site and comes with all the SEO benefits. Configure meta tags like title and description for each markdown file using MDX Frontmatter

```markdown
---
title: "Title of the page"
metaTitle: "Meta Title Tag for this page"
metaDescription: "Meta Description Tag for this page"
---
```

Canonical URLs are generated automatically.
