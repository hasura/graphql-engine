After adding appropriate values, click `Save`.

## Checking the status of the integration

The green/red dot signifies the status of the integration. Green signifies successful exporting of logs to New Relic. When logs are successfully exported, `Last Exported` is continuously updated, indicating the timestamp of the last log line successfully exported to your New Relic account.

In case there is an error while exporting logs to New Relic, the dot is red and the HTTP status code of the error is displayed right below it.

## View logs

The logs can be viewed in your New Relic dashboard, under the `Logs` tab ([read more on New Relic docs](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/log-management/get-started/get-started-log-management/#find-data)). To navigate to the same, click `View Logs`.

To view only logs exported by Hasura Cloud, filter your logs using `attributes` you configured with this integration.

## View metrics

The integration exports the following five metrics to your New Relic account:

| Metric Exported                | Metric Name in New Relic      |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Average number of requests     | `average_requests_per_minute` |
| Average request execution time | `average_execution_time`      |
| Success rate of requests       | `success_rate`                |
| Active subscriptions           | `active_subscriptions`        |
| Number of websockets open      | `websockets_open`             |

Non zero values of all the above metrics are exported over a one minute time interval. Each metric name is prefixed with `hasura_cloud`.

Graphs for all the above metrics can be viewed in your New Relic account. Under `Browse Data` select `Metrics` and choose the metrics name. To navigate to New Relic dashboard, click `View Metrics`.
