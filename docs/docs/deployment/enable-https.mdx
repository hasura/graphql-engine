# Enable HTTPS

## Setting up HTTPS

Hasura GraphQL engine does not handle SSL/TLS for your API. That means,
Hasura GraphQL engine cannot serve your API on an HTTPS URL.

You should use a reverse proxy (like Nginx, Caddy, Kong, Traefik etc.)
or the cloud provider's native load balancer SSL termination features to
secure your API.

## Sample configurations

Here are a few sample configurations for some popular proxies:

### [Nginx](https://nginx.org/en/docs/)

Here is a sample `nginx.conf` to proxy requests to Hasura:

```nginx
server {
  listen 80;
  listen 443 ssl;
  server_name hasura.<my-domain.com>;

  location / {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:8080/;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
  }
}
```

Please note that setting up SSL is not covered in this guide. You can
find more information at [Nginx docs](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/configuring_https_servers.html).

To serve Hasura with a URL prefix instead of a separate subdomain, use `location /hasura/` or similar.

### [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/)

Here is a sample `Caddyfile` to proxy requests to Hasura:

```bash
hasura.<my-domain.com> {
  reverse_proxy localhost:8080
}
```

Caddy has TLS provisioning built-in with Let's Encrypt or ZeroSSL. You can find the docs at [Caddy website](https://caddyserver.com/docs/automatic-https).

In order to serve at a URL prefix, use the following configuration:

```bash
<my-domain.com> {
  handle_path /hasura* {
    reverse_proxy localhost:8080
  }

  handle {
    # Fallback for otherwise unhandled requests
  }
}
```

### [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/)

Here are sample `traefik.toml` and `traefik-dynamic.toml` files to proxy requests to Hasura:

```toml
#traefik.toml

[providers]
  [providers.file]
    filename = "traefik-dynamic.toml"

[api]
  dashboard = true
  debug = true

[entryPoints]
  [entryPoints.web]
    address = ":80"

    [entryPoints.web.http]
      [entryPoints.web.http.redirections]
        [entryPoints.web.http.redirections.entryPoint]
          to = "web-secure"
          scheme = "https"

  [entryPoints.web-secure]
    address = ":443"

[certificatesResolvers.sample.acme]
  email = "myemail@example.com"
  storage = "acme.json"

  [certificatesResolvers.sample.acme.httpChallenge]
    # used during the challenge
    entryPoint = "web"
```


```toml
#traefik-dynamic.toml

[http]
    [http.routers]
       [http.routers.my-router]
          rule = "Host(`hasura.example.com`)"
          service = "hasura"
          entryPoints = ["web-secure"]
       [http.routers.my-router.tls]
          certResolver = "sample"

    [http.services]
        [http.services.hasura.loadbalancer]
            [[http.services.hasura.loadbalancer.servers]]
                url = "http://127.0.0.1:5000"
```

In order to serve at a URL prefix, use the following configuration:

```toml
#traefik-dynamic.toml
...

    [http.routers]
       [http.routers.my-router]
          rule = "Host(`example.com`) && Path(`/hasura`))"
          service = "hasura"
          entryPoints = ["web-secure"]
       [http.routers.my-router.tls]
          certResolver = "sample"

...
```
Please note that setting up SSL is not covered in this guide. You can
