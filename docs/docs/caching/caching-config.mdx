# Caching Config

## Introduction

Hasura Cloud and Enterprise Edition provide support for caching query responses. This will drastically improve
performance for queries which are executed frequently. This includes any GraphQL query including Actions and Remote
Schemas.

Cached responses are stored for a period of time in a LRU (least-recently used) cache, and removed from the cache as per
a user-specified TTL (time-to-live) which defaults to 60 seconds.

## Getting started

In order to cache a query response, or to return an existing response from the cache (if one exists), simply add the
`@cached` directive to your query:

```graphql
query MyCachedQuery @cached {
  users {
    id
    name
  }
}
```

If the response was cached successfully, the HTTP response will include a `Cache-Control` header, whose value
(`max-age={SECONDS}`) indicates the maximum number of seconds for the returned response to remain in the cache.

A query's response can be cached only if the following conditions hold:

- For queries using `Actions` or `Remote Schemas`, the query does **not** make use of `forward_client_headers` (see
  [RemoteSchemaDef](/api-reference/syntax-defs.mdx#remoteschemadef) and
  [ActionDefinition](/api-reference/syntax-defs.mdx#actiondefinition)).
- The response JSON is **under** 100KB in size

For self-hosted Enterprise Edition, refer to the [enable caching](/enterprise/caching.mdx) documentation.

## Controlling cache lifetime

The maximum lifetime of an entry in the cache can be controlled using the `ttl` argument to the `@cached` query
directive. The value is an integer number of seconds:

```graphql
query MyCachedQuery @cached(ttl: 120) {
  users {
    id
    name
  }
}
```

By default, a response will be cached with a maximum lifetime of 60 seconds. The maximum allowed value is 300 seconds (5
minutes).

## Forcing the cache to refresh

The cache entry can be forced to refresh, regardless of the maximum lifetime using the `refresh` argument to `@cached`.
The value is a boolean:

```graphql
query MyCachedQuery @cached(refresh: true) {
  users {
    id
    name
  }
}
```

## Rate Limiting

Cache writes are rate limited, with a rate depending on your plan. The rate limit is based on the total number of bytes
written to the cache in a sliding window. If you exceed the rate limit, the HTTP response will indicate this with a
warning header:

```plaintext
 Warning: 199 - cache-store-capacity-exceeded
```

:::info SLIDING WINDOW POLICIES

A sliding window policy maintains a queue of a specified size, into which entities flow. When the queue is full and a
new entity arrives, the oldest entity in the queue is removed from the window (FIFO).

:::

## Session variables

A session variable will only influence the cache key for a query if it is referenced by the execution plan. In practice,
this means that session variables are only factored into cache keys if they are referenced in the permissions for a
query. See the [API permissions](/api-reference/metadata-api/permission.mdx) documentation for more information.

## Response headers

When you enable caching for a query, the following headers should be returned in the HTTP response:

- `X-Hasura-Query-Cache-Key` - Key for cached query response, unique to this query
- `X-Hasura-Query-Family-Cache-Key` - Key for the family of queries (ignores variable values)
- `Cache-Control` - Value: `max-age={SECONDS}` - Seconds until cache expires for query

These can be used by your application as you see fit, as well as by the cache-clearing endpoints.

## Clearing items from the cache

A set of endpoints exist to clear items from the cache for the current project:

- `POST /pro/cache/clear` -- Clears all
- `POST /pro/cache/clear?key={HASH}` -- Clears key hash
- `POST /pro/cache/clear?family={FAMILY}` -- Clears items that match query family (ignoring variables)
