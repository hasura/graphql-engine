-- | The RTS's idle GC doesn't work for us:
--
--    - when `-I` is too low it may fire continuously causing scary high CPU
--      when idle among other issues (see #2565)
--    - when we set it higher it won't run at all leading to memory being
--      retained when idle (especially noticeable when users are benchmarking and
--      see memory stay high after finishing). In the theoretical worst case
--      there is such low haskell heap pressure that we never run finalizers to
--      free the foreign data from e.g. libpq.
--    - as of GHC 8.10.2 we have access to `-Iw`, but those two knobs still
--      donâ€™t give us a guarantee that a major GC will always run at some
--      minumum frequency (e.g. for finalizers)
--
-- ...so we hack together our own using GHC.Stats, which should have
-- insignificant runtime overhead.
