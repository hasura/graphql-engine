Introduction
------------

To use the Hasura GraphQL engine, you need to:

- Deploy the Hasura GraphQL engine, with access to a Postgres database to store its metadata.
- Connect new/existing database(s) and set up and test your GraphQL API using the Hasura console UI *(also possible via CLI or API)*.
- Consume the generated GraphQL API from your client apps.

Quickstart guides
-----------------

- :ref:`Using Hasura Cloud <cloud_getting_started>` - Create a new Hasura Cloud project with just a few clicks.

  - Recommended as it's **the fastest way** to try Hasura GraphQL engine out.
  - Comes with **extra features for reliability and security** and a managed metadata database.

Hasura is open-source and can also be downloaded locally. :ref:`Set up Hasura GraphQL engine using Docker Compose <docker_simple>`. This is recommended if you want to **run Hasura locally** or if your database cannot be exposed to Hasura Cloud.

.. TODO: add link to detailed deployment guides post 2.0 content update
