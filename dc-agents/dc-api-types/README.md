# Hasura GraphQL Engine Data Connector Agent API Types

This package contains TypeScript types that Data Connector agents implemented in TypeScript could use to correctly implement the API required.

The [Data Connector Reference agent](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/tree/master/dc-agents/reference) can be used as an example of these types being used in practice to implement a Data Connector agent.
