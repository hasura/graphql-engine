# Hasura Console Development Tooling

This document explains different toolings that we use at Hasura console team.

### Storybook

[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) is used to ease isolated component development. Idea is to have component stories for the new components with/without business logic.

#### What is a story?

A story captures the rendered state of a UI component. It’s a function that returns a component’s state given a set of arguments.

Stories can have mock data to render the component that handles different type of UI rendering and user events. Mocks are mainly used as props or network mocks to simulate constant data.

It can be considered as a documentation + example instances of a UI component.

When there are hooks inside the component (side effects) that fetches the data from network call, [MSW](https://mswjs.io) is used to mock the API call.

#### How to start storybook?

```bash
npm run storybook
```

### React-Query

[React-query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/) is used for data fetching and related state management purpose.

#### Debugging (React-Query DevTools)

Console code has enabled [DevTools](https://react-query.tanstack.com/devtools) on development environment. This helps developers to understand the state of each queries with visualisation.

### Redux

[Redux](https://redux.js.org/) is currently used in the console code for global state management, data fetching etc. but we are trying reduce redux usage and increase component level states and react query for API states.

#### Debugging (Redux DevTools)

Console development server can be debugged with the [redux devtools](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-devtools) for debugging redux state changes.

### XState

[XState](https://xstate.js.org/) is introduced to simplify the state management, we use it mostly at the component level to make component development easier.

### Tailwind CSS

[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is used as the main CSS framework

### Mock Service Worker

[MSW](https://mswjs.io) is used to mock network calls for testing purpose. It is mainly used to test hooks, components, and on component stories.

### react-hook-form

[react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/) is used to build new form components.

### Zod

[Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) is used for schema validation.

### Linter and Formatter

Pre-commit git-hook that runs linter and formatter is by default disabled. You can enable it by adding `HUSKY_PRE_COMMIT=true` to your `.env` file.

- [ESlint](https://eslint.org/) is used as the linter on console code.
  If you want to run a linter for all files, you can do:

  ```bash
  npm run lint
  ```

- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) is used as the code formatter on console code.
  To format all files, you can run:

  ```bash
  npm run format
  ```

### E2E and Unit Tests

- E2E Tests are written using [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) .

  - Run tests: `npm run cypress`
  - Write your tests in the `cypress/integration` directory.

- Unit tests are written using [Jest Framework](https://jestjs.io/)
  - Tests are written inside `__test__` folder of respective services.
  - Unit testing is mostly applied on the utility functions.
  - If you want to run tests, execute `npm run jest` or `npm run jest-watch` (for watch mode)
  - [Snapshot testing](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/snapshot-testing) is also used with unit tests.
  - when you want to update the snapshot, you can run `npm run jest -- -u` or press `u` if you are in jest-watch mode.

### Chromatic

[Chromatic](https://www.chromatic.com/) is used for visual testing the stories.
If you have a story you do not wish to snapshot in Chromatic, you can disable snapshotting with the [disableSnapshot](https://www.chromatic.com/docs/ignoring-elements#ignore-stories) story parameter.

### Webpack

[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) is used for module bundling. Different webpack configurations are used to optimise production build and development server.

### Husky

[Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) is used to configure pre-commit git-hook that runs linter and formatter. You can enable it by adding `HUSKY_PRE_COMMIT=true` to your `.env` file.
