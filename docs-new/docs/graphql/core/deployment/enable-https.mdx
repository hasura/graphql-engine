# Enable HTTPS

## Setting up HTTPS

Hasura GraphQL engine does not handle SSL/TLS for your API. That means,
Hasura GraphQL engine cannot serve your API on an HTTPS URL.

You should use a reverse proxy (like Nginx, Caddy, Kong, Traefik etc.)
or the cloud provider's native load balancer SSL termination features to
secure your API.

## Sample configurations

Here are a few sample configurations for some popular proxies:

### [Nginx](https://nginx.org/en/docs/)

Here is a sample `nginx.conf` to proxy requests to Hasura:

```nginx
server {
  listen 80;
  listen 443 ssl;
  server_name hasura.<my-domain.com>;

  location / {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:8080/;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
  }
}
```

Please note that setting up SSL is not covered in this guide. You can
find more information at [Nginx docs](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/configuring_https_servers.html).

To serve Hasura with a URL prefix instead of a separate subdomain, use `location /hasura/` or similar.


### [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/)

Here is a sample `Caddyfile` to proxy requests to Hasura:

```bash
hasura.<my-domain.com> {
  reverse_proxy localhost:8080
}
```

Caddy has TLS provisioning built-in with Let's Encrypt or ZeroSSL. You can find the docs at [Caddy website](https://caddyserver.com/docs/automatic-https).

In order to serve at a URL prefix, use the following configuration:

```bash
<my-domain.com> {
  handle_path /hasura* {
    reverse_proxy localhost:8080
  }

  handle {
    # Fallback for otherwise unhandled requests
  }
}
```
