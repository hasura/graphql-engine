# Postgres: Enum type fields

## Introduction

Enum type fields are restricted to a fixed set of allowed values.

## Enums in a database

In a relational database such as Postgres, an enum type field in a table
can be defined in two ways:

### Using [native Postgres enum types](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-enum.html) {#pg-native-enum}

While the most obvious solution, native enum types have significant
drawbacks: they are not easily mutable. New values cannot be added to an
enum inside a transaction (that is, `ALTER TYPE ... ADD VALUE` is not
supported by transactional DDL), and values cannot be removed from an
enum at all without completely dropping and recreating it (which cannot
be done if the enum is in use by *any* tables, views, or functions).
Therefore, native enum types should only be used for enums that are
guaranteed to *never* change, such as days of the week.

### Using [foreign-key references](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/tutorial-fk.html) to a single-column table {#pg-reference-table-enum}

This approach represents an enum using ordinary relational database
concepts. The enum type is represented by a table, and the values of the
enum are rows in the table. Columns in other tables that use the enum
are ordinary foreign-key references to the enum table.

For enums with values that are dynamic and may require updates, such as
a list of tags or user roles, this approach is strongly recommended.
Modifying an enum defined this way is easy: simply insert, update, or
delete rows in the enum table (and updates or deletes can even be
cascaded to references, and they may be done within a transaction).

## Enums in the Hasura GraphQL engine

Given the limitations of native Postgres enum types (as described
[above](#pg-native-enum)), Hasura currently only generates GraphQL enum
types for enums defined using the [referenced tables](#pg-reference-table-enum) approach.

You may use native Postgres enum types in your database schema, but they
will essentially be treated like text fields in the generated GraphQL
schema. Therefore, this guide focuses primarily on modeling an enum
using a reference table, but you may still use native Postgres enum
types to help maintain data consistency in your database. You can always
choose to create a table with the values of a Postgres enum as shown in
the [section below](#pg-create-enum-table-from-pg-enum).

**Example:** Let’s say we have a database that tracks user information,
and users may only have one of three specific roles: user, moderator, or
administrator. To represent that, we might have a `users` table with the
following schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id serial PRIMARY KEY,
  name text NOT NULL,
  role text NOT NULL
);
```

Now we can insert some users into our database:

```sql
INSERT INTO users (name, role) VALUES
  ('Alyssa', 'administrator'),
  ('Ben', 'moderator'),
  ('Gerald', 'user');
```

This works alright, but it doesn’t prevent us from inserting nonsensical
values for `role`, such as

```sql
INSERT INTO users (name, role) VALUES
  ('Hal', 'spaghetti');
```

which we certainly don’t want. Hence we should create an enum to
restrict the allowed values.

### Creating an enum compatible table {#pg-create-enum-table}

To represent an enum, we’re going to create an \_<em>enum table</em>, which for Hasura’s purposes is any table that meets the following restrictions:

1.  The table must have a single-column primary key of type `text`. The
    values of this column are the legal values of the enum, and they
    must all be [valid GraphQL enum value names](https://graphql.github.io/graphql-spec/June2018/#EnumValue).
2.  Optionally, the table may have a second column, also of type `text`,
    which will be used as a description of each value in the generated
    GraphQL schema.
3.  The table must not contain any other columns.
4.  The table must contain at least 1 row.

**For example**, to create an enum that represents our user roles, we
would create the following table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE user_role (
  value text PRIMARY KEY,
  comment text
);

INSERT INTO user_role (value, comment) VALUES
  ('user', 'Ordinary users'),
  ('moderator', 'Users with the privilege to ban users'),
  ('administrator', 'Users with the privilege to set users’ roles');
```

<div id="pg-create-enum-table-from-pg-enum"/>

:::info Creating an enum table from a native PG enum

You can create a table containing the values of a PG enum by executing
the following SQL:

```sql
CREATE TABLE "<my_enum_table>" (value TEXT PRIMARY KEY);
INSERT INTO "<my_enum_table>" (value) (SELECT unnest(enum_range(NULL::"<my_enum>")))::text);
```

:::

Next, we need to tell Hasura that this table represents an enum.

### Setting a table as an enum table

Once we have a table which satisfies the conditions for an enum table as
described [above](#pg-create-enum-table), we need to tell Hasura that
this table represents an enum.

<Tabs className="api-tabs">
<TabItem value="console" label="Console">

Head to the `Data -> [table-name] -> Modify` tab in the console and
toggle the switch in the `Set table as enum` section:

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/graphql/core/schema/enum-set.png"
  alt="Set table as enum"
/>

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">
To set a table as an enum, change the `tables.yaml` file in the
`metadata` directory as follows:

```yaml {4}
- table:
    schema: public
    name: user_role
  is_enum: true
```

Apply the metadata by running:

```bash
hasura metadata apply
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="api" label="API">
A table can be set as an enum via the following 2 methods:

1.  Passing `true` for the `is_enum` option of the
    [pg_track_table](/graphql/core/api-reference/metadata-api/table-view.mdx#metadata-pg-track-table) metadata API while tracking a table:

    ```http {11}
    POST /v1/metadata HTTP/1.1
    Content-Type: application/json
    X-Hasura-Role: admin

    {
      "type": "pg_track_table",
      "args": {
        "source": "<db_name>",
        "schema": "public",
        "name": "user_role",
        "is_enum": true
      }
    }
    ```

2.  Using the [pg_set_table_is_enum](/graphql/core/api-reference/metadata-api/table-view.mdx#metadata-pg-set-table-is-enum) metadata API to change
    whether or not an already-tracked table should be used as an enum:

    ```http
    POST /v1/metadata HTTP/1.1
    Content-Type: application/json
    X-Hasura-Role: admin

    {
      "type": "pg_set_table_is_enum",
      "args": {
        "source": "<db_name>",
        "table": {
          "schema": "public",
          "name": "user_role"
        },
        "is_enum": true
      }
    }
    ```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Using an enum table

To set a field of a table as an enum in the GraphQL schema, we need to
set a reference from it to the enum table via a foreign key.

**For example**, to update our `users` table to reference the
`user_role` enum table:

```sql
ALTER TABLE users ADD CONSTRAINT
  users_role_fkey FOREIGN KEY (role) REFERENCES user_role;
```

### Making queries using enum values

Once a table has been tracked as an enum, the GraphQL schema will be
updated to expose the values of the table as GraphQL enum values i.e.
only the exposed values will be permitted for all fields referencing to
it.

**For example**, the `role` column of the `users` table only permits the
values in the `user_role` table:

```graphql
type users {
  id: Int!
  name: String!
  role: user_role_enum!
}

enum user_role_enum {
  "Users with the privilege to set users’ roles"
  administrator

  "Users with the privilege to ban users"
  moderator

  "Ordinary users"
  user
}
```

When making queries that filter on the `role` column, use the name of
the enum value directly rather than providing a string:

<GraphiQLIDE
  query={`{
  users(
    where: {
      role: {_eq: administrator}
    }
  ) {
    id
    name
  }
}`}
response={`{
  "data": {
    "users": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Alyssa"
      }
    ]
  }
}`}
/>

### Enums and migrations

As enum tables have a requirement to contain at least 1 row, it is
necessary to have a migration which inserts values into an enum table.
Otherwise while applying migrations an error would be thrown while
trying to set the table as an enum.

The migration which inserts values into an enum table needs to be
between the migration creating the table and the migration setting it as
an enum.

This can be achieved via the console by performing the following steps
while setting up an enum table:

1.  Create the enum table
2.  Use the `RawSQL` tab of the console to insert the enum values into
    the table and mark the insert as a migration
3.  Set the table as an enum

You can also [manually create migration files](/graphql/core/migrations/advanced/writing-migrations-manually.mdx) to
achieve this.

### Current limitations

Currently, Hasura does not automatically detect changes to the contents
of enum tables, so the GraphQL schema will only be updated after
[manually reloading metadata](/graphql/core/migrations/manage-metadata.mdx#reload-metadata-manual) after inserting,
updating, or deleting rows from an enum table.
