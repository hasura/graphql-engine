# General Style Points

- Try to include a `TL;DR` block for feature documentation at the top of the doc to summarise it as much as possible.
- Hasura features should be proper noun _title case_ to differentiate from any other uses of the word Eg: Console,
  Metadata, Migrations, Actions, Events, etc.
- Keep in mind you are trying to write for beginner, intermediate and advanced users.
- All lines in markdown should break at **120 characters** for better readability in IDEs. 120 is useful because it
  still allows side-by-side editing on most screens and closely matches the line length of the final output page at max
  width.
