# Prometheus Integration

## Introduction

You can export metrics of your Hasura Cloud project to [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/).
This can be configured on the integrations tab on the project's setting page.

:::info Note

Prometheus Integration is only available for Hasura Cloud projects on the `Standard` (pay-as-you-go) tier and above.

:::


## Configure Prometheus integration

Navigate to the integrations tab on project settings page to find Prometheus integration.

Enter the Namespace and label values to be associated to the exported metrics and click on <em>Connect Integration</em>.

| Field                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Namespace (Optional) | The single word prefix relevant to the domain the metrics belong to. [Read more about namespace on Prometheus docs.](https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/naming/#metric-names)                |
| Labels (Optional)    | [Labels](https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/naming/#labels) are key-value pairs associated with your metrics used to differentiate the characteristics of the metric that is being measured. |

## Prometheus instance configuration

The Prometheus instance(Agent) needs to be configured with Basic Auth
mode with Project ID as username and the generated Access token as Password.
The Connection URL is needed to configure the Scrape Target rule.

### Access Token

The Access Token is generated once the Integration is created.
The token is showed only once and cannot be retrieved again.
Access token is used as the password for Basic Authentication by the Prometheus Agent.

  alt="Prometheus Access Token"
  width="1146px"
/>

The token can be re-generated from the Configuration Panel of the Integration. This action is permanent and cannot be reversed.

### Connection URL

This is the secured webhook URL which exposes the Project Metrics in the
prometheus compatible format. It has 3 parts namely scheme, host name and metrics_path.
For example, if the connection URL is `https://prometheus-exporter.pro.hasura.io/metrics`,
then the scheme is `https`, host name (This includes sub-domains as well) is
`prometheus-exporter.pro.hasura.io` and metrics_path is `/metrics`.

### Project ID

The Project ID is used as the Username for the Basic Authentication by the Prometheus agent.

<Thumbnail

  alt="Prometheus Copy Project ID"
  width="1146px"
/>

The following YAML template can be used as the [config file](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/)
to establish connectivity with the exposed Integration.

```yaml
global:
    scrape_interval:     60s 
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'hasura_prometheus_exporter'
    scrape_interval: 60s ## Recommended scrape interval is 60s
    metrics_path: '/metrics' ## Replace with metrics Path of the connection URL
    scheme: 'https' ## Replace with the scheme of the connection URL
    basic_auth:
      username: 'd01c60e1-1b11-564d-bb09-0a39e3e41b05' ## Replace with project ID
      password: 'IrhO3GlR8oXTfsdfdsNs8Nj' ## Replace with Access Token     
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['prometheus-exporter.pro.hasura.io'] ## Replace with the host name of the connection URL
```

## Checking the status of the integration

The green/red dot signifies the status of the integration. Green
signifies successful exporting of metrics to Prometheus. When metrics
are successfully exported, `Last Exported` is continuously updated,
indicating the timestamp of the last metric successfully exported to
your Prometheus Instance.

/>

In case there is an error while exporting metrics to Prometheus,
the dot is red and the error message is displayed right below it.

## Metrics details

The integration exports the following five metrics to your Prometheus
Instance:

| Metric Exported                | Metric Name in Prometheus     |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Average number of requests     | `average_requests_per_minute` |
| Average request execution time | `average_execution_time`      |
| Success rate of requests       | `success_rate`                |
| Active subscriptions           | `active_subscriptions`        |
| Number of websockets open      | `websockets_open`             |

:::info Note

If `average_requests_per_minute` is `0` (Which means no incoming
requests in the Last one minute), `average_execution_time` is reported
as `0` and `success_rate` is reported as 1 to avoid `NaN` values in
Prometheus.

:::

:::info Note

If `Namespace` and `Labels` are configured (Optional), the format of the
metric identifier is `namespace_metricName{key1=value1, key2=value2}`

:::

## View metrics

The metrics can be queried from the Prometheus Dashboard (or using tools like [Grafana](https://prometheus.io/docs/visualization/grafana/))
