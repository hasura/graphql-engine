title: "Basic Data Modelling"
---

In this part of the course, we will build the data model for a realtime todo app. Our todo app will have the following features:

- Users can maintain personal todos
- Users can view public todos
- A list of current online users using the app

Broadly this means that we have two models in this app: `users` and `todos`, each with its own set of properties.

We will go over them in the subsequent steps.
