This course is a concise and powerful introduction to GraphQL for React Native developers.

Weâ€™ve structured this course to cover fundamental concepts of both GraphQL and using GraphQL in react native, in the shortest amount of time possible. The course is light on opinions so that once you grok the fundamentals you can go on to choose your favourite tools and tailor your workflow.

## Key topics and takeways:

- GraphQL vs REST
- GraphQL queries, mutations, subscriptions
- Setting up a GraphQL client with Apollo
- Integrating GraphQL queries in your react native app
- Integrating GraphQL mutations in your app to change data on the server
- Updating local state after a GraphQL mutation (TextInput) using Apollo cache
- Automatic updates to local state and UI after GraphQL update mutations
- Using subscriptions with a subscriptions components
- Building a real-time feed with notifications using mutations and subscriptions

## What will be building?

We will be building a realtime todo app using authenticated GraphQL APIs. 

## Will this course teach React Native concepts as well?
No, we will be simulating a scenario where we already have a
GraphQL API and the basic UI of a react native app built. Our task in this
scenario is to integrate the GraphQL APIs into our react native app to build
a complete and working app.

## What do I need to take this tutorial?
You need to have npm/yarn & node 8+ running.

## How long will this tutorial take?
Less than 2 hours
