# Data Federation

## Introduction

Hasuraâ€™s data federation capabilities allow you to compose data from different sources
that reside in independent data stores but are semantically related. This is done by creating
a single GraphQL schema from multiple data sources thereby making the data access process
self-serve, allowing you to query, mutate or federate real-time and stream data across services
without writing any custom code.

The remote data sources can either be a table from a [database source](/graphql/core/databases/index.mdx),
a GraphQL API added as a [remote schema](/graphql/core/remote-schemas/index.mdx),
or a REST API added as an [action](/graphql/core/actions/index.mdx). Once you create
relationships between types from your database tables, remote schemas and actions, you can then "join" data
across them by running GraphQL queries.

## Types of remote relationships

Hasura GraphQL engine supports the following relationships across your various data sources:

- [Database to database relationships](/graphql/core/databases/postgres/schema/remote-relationships/remote-source-relationships.mdx): To join
data across tables between two different database sources, such as order information stored in a Postgres database, and user information stored
in a separate Postgres or say a SQL Server database.
- [Database to Remote Schema relationships](/graphql/core/databases/postgres/schema/remote-relationships/remote-schema-relationships.mdx): To
join data across tables and remote GraphQL APIs. For example, you can join customer data from your tables with account data from Stripe, Spotify,
or Auth0 via their GraphQL APIs.
- [Remote Schema to database relationships](/graphql/core/remote-schemas/remote-relationships/remote-schema-db-relationships.mdx): To join
data from remote GraphQL schemas to database tables. For example connecting account data from Stripe, Spotify or Auth0 GraphQL APIs to customer data in your tables.
- [Remote Schema to Remote Schema relationships (a.k.a GraphQL joins)](/graphql/core/remote-schemas/remote-relationships/remote-schema-relationships.mdx): To
join data between two remote GraphQL schemas. For example connecting customer data from your custom GraphQL API to account data from Stripe, Spotify or
Auth0 GraphQL APIs.
- [Action to database relationships](/graphql/core/databases/postgres/schema/remote-relationships/action-relationships.mdx): To join data across
tables and actions (i.e. Rest APIs). For example, you can join user data from your database with the response from a `createUser` action.
