         Open your linux shell and run the following command:

         .. code-block:: bash

            curl -L https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/raw/master/cli/get.sh | bash

         This will install the Hasura CLI in ``/usr/local/bin``. You might have to provide
         your ``sudo`` password depending on the permissions of your ``/usr/local/bin`` location.

         If you'd prefer to install to a different location other than ``/usr/local/bin``, set the
         env var ``INSTALL_PATH``:

         .. code-block:: bash

            curl -L https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/raw/master/cli/get.sh | INSTALL_PATH=$HOME/bin bash

         .. code-block:: bash

            curl -L https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/raw/master/cli/get.sh | bash

         This will install the Hasura CLI in ``/usr/local/bin``. You might have to provide
         your ``sudo`` password depending on the permissions of your ``/usr/local/bin`` location.

         If you'd prefer to install to a different location other than ``/usr/local/bin``, set the
         env var ``INSTALL_PATH``:

         Download the binary ``cli-hasura-windows-amd64.exe`` available under ``Assets`` of the latest release
         from the GitHub release page: https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/releases

         Rename the downloaded file to ``hasura``.

(Optional) Add shell completion
