# Single Sign-on Configuration

<div className="badge badge--primary heading-badge">Available on: Self-hosted Enterprise</div>

## Configuration

### Configuring the identity provider

Create a new service provider on your identity provider with the following configuration:

1. Configure the allowed origin, CORS to be where the Hasura Console is hosted.
2. Set the callback URL to `http(s)://<hasura-domain>/console/oauth2/callback`.
3. Ensure the ID token option is enabled.
4. Add `"x-hasura-allowed-roles": ["admin"]` and `"x-hasura-default-role": "admin"` into the JWT custom claims. The JWT
   payload should follow the [Hasura JWT spec](/auth/authentication/jwt.mdx#example-decoded-payload).

Once created, note the client ID, login URL, request token URL, and JWT secret.

### Configuring Hasura Enterprise

Set the [`--sso-providers`](/deployment/graphql-engine-flags/reference.mdx#single-sign-on-providers) argument
(`HASURA_GRAPHQL_SSO_PROVIDERS`) which takes a list of SSO provider objects.

```json
[
  {
    "client_id": "<client-id-from-idp>",
    "name": "<display-name>",
    "scope": "openid",
    "authorization_url": "<login-url>",
    "request_token_url": "<request-token-url>",
    "admin_roles": ["admin"],
    "jwt_secret": {
      "type": "RS256",
      "jwk_url": "https://...",
      "issuer": "myapp"
    }
  }
]
```

- `client_id`: Client ID of the identity application.
- `name`: Display name of the SSO button in the login page of the Hasura Console.
- `scope`: The OAuth scope. It must contain `openid` so the identity provider can return the JWT `id_token` from the
  request token endpoint.
- `authorization_url`: The authorization URL that the browser redirects to from the Console.
- `request_token_url`: URL the Console uses to get the ID token using the authorization code.
- `admin_roles`: By default, the role should be `admin` in the token issued by IdP so that Console access is provided.
  But, if you have a configuration where the `admin` role is used for something else, set this key to indicate which
  roles should be treated as admin. This is an array of strings.
- `jwt_secret`: JWT secret the server uses to verify the JWT signature. It follows the
  [JWT secret configuration](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/auth/authentication/jwt/#configure-hasura-jwt-mode).

## Other protocols

You can use any OpenID Connect compliant middleware service such as [Dex](https://github.com/dexidp/dex) that acts as a
portal to other identity providers. Hasura talks to the middleware to authorize and verify signatures without caring
about how the middleware handles external providers. Dex supports [SAML 2.0](https://dexidp.io/docs/connectors/saml/),
[LDAP](https://dexidp.io/docs/connectors/ldap/) protocols, as well as identity providers like GitHub, Google, and Active
Directory.

### SAML configuration

#### Configuring the identity provider

Create a new service provider on your SAML identity provider with the following configuration:

1. Configure the callback URL to be `http(s)://<dex-url>/callback`.
2. Note the sign-on endpoint, entity ID, and issuer.
3. Download the CA certificate.
4. Note the XML attribute paths of username, email, and roles so Dex can map those attributes to JWT custom claims. You
   can find them in the Federation metadata document.

#### Configuring Dex

Create a config file with a static client and a SAML connector.

```yaml
# The default Dex base URL is http://localhost:5556/dex
# However the /dex path is removed in the helm chart
issuer: http(s)://<dex-url>

storage:
  type: memory

# Configuration for the HTTP endpoints.
web:
  http: 0.0.0.0:5556
  allowedOrigins: ['*']

staticClients:
  - id: hasura-app
    redirectURIs:
      - 'http(s)://<hasura-url>/console/oauth2/callback'
    name: 'Hasura App'
    public: true

connectors:
  - type: saml
    id: saml
    name: SAML
    config:
      ssoURL: <SAML sign-on endpoint>
      # CA to use when validating the signature of the SAML response.
      ca: /path/to/saml-ca.pem

      # CA's can also be provided inline as a base64'd blob.
      #
      # caData: ( RAW base64'd PEM encoded CA )

      # To skip signature validation, uncomment the following field. This should
      # only be used during testing and may be removed in the future.
      #
      # insecureSkipSignatureValidation: true

      redirectURI: http(s)://<dex-url>/callback
      # Name of attributes in the returned assertions to map to ID token claims.
      usernameAttr: name
      emailAttr: email
      # groups are required to be mapped with x-hasura-allowed-roles
      groupsAttr: groups

      # Optional: Manually specify dex's Issuer value.
      #
      # When provided dex will include this as the Issuer value during AuthnRequest.
      # It will also override the redirectURI as the required audience when evaluating
      # AudienceRestriction elements in the response.
      entityIssuer: http(s)://<dex-url>/callback

      # Optional: Issuer value expected in the SAML response.
      # ssoIssuer: https://login.microsoftonline.com/4bc01d1d-5a16-4d79-b651-5a5b592aeb57/v2.0
```

### Configuring Hasura Enterprise

Set the environment variable `HASURA_GRAPHQL_SSO_PROVIDERS` to talk to Dex.

```json
[
  {
    "client_id": "hasura-app",
    "name": "SAML Login",
    "scope": "openid offline_access groups",
    "authorization_url": "http(s)://<dex-url>/auth",
    "request_token_url": "http(s)://<dex-url>/token",
    "admin_roles": ["admin"],
    "jwt_secret": {
      "type": "RS256",
      "jwk_url": "http(s)://<dex-url>/keys",
      "issuer": "http(s)://<dex-url>",
      "claims_map": {
        "x-hasura-allowed-roles": { "path": "$.groups" },
        "x-hasura-default-role": { "path": "$.groups[0]" }
      }
    }
  }
]
```

The `groups` scope is required to enable the `groups` field in the JWT claims. You also need to set the `claims_map` to
map the `groups` field to `x-hasura-allowed-roles` and `x-hasura-default-role`.
