# Connect Databases to Hasura GraphQL Engine

## Introduction

You can quickly and easily connect a new, existing, or demo database to Hasura GraphQL Engine.

You can also connect to multiple databases and build a unified GraphQL API.

## Connect a database via the Hasura Console {#connect-database-v2-0}

Once you have [created a Hasura Cloud Project](/projects/create.mdx), click `Launch Console` to open the Hasura
console in your browser.

On the Hasura Console, navigate to the `Data` tab, you will see the "Connect Database" screen.

### Connect to or create a new database

Hasura Cloud does not host databases, but does provide integrations with which you can connect databases from
many 3rd party managed cloud providers. Check out a
[list of supported databases here](/databases/index.mdx#supported-databases).

To get started with a demo database, choose `Create New Database`:

  alt="database setup with existing
database"
/>

Select `Create Neon Database` and follow the prompts or
[check out our detailed Neon connect page](/databases/connect-db/cloud-databases/neon.mdx). Hasura Cloud will
integrate with your Neon account and manage the initial setup of a Postgres instance. You can always upgrade the
instance and manage options later through your Neon account:

database"
/>

### Connect to an existing database

To use an existing database, choose `Connect existing database` and enter your database connection URL and enter your
database connection string (looks like `postgres://username:password@hostname:port/dbname`).

For help finding your particular connection string for your database provider check out our
[supported databases](/databases/index.mdx#supported-databases) and
[cloud providers](/databases/connect-db/cloud-databases/index.mdx) pages.

You can connect to databases either using env vars or by using their raw connection string/parameters. It is
recommended to use env vars for better security _(as connection details are part of Hasura Metadata)_ as well as to
allow configuring different databases in different environments _(like staging/production)_ easily.

A database can be connected to using the `HASURA_GRAPHQL_DATABASE_URL` env var as well in which case it gets
added automatically as a database named `default`.

### Allowing connections from Hasura Cloud IP {#cloud-projects-create-allow-nat-ip}

For some cloud services, like GCP, you'll need to adjust your connection settings to allow connections from the
Hasura Cloud IP address. You can copy the IP address from the copy icon in the `Hasura Cloud IP` field on the Project's
details view which you can shortcut to by clicking on your Project name in the Console.

<Thumbnail src="/img/projects/project-general-ip-address_console_2.12.png" alt="Hasura Cloud IP field" />

Below is an example of adding the IP address of the Hasura Cloud instance to a GCP Cloud SQL instance.

## Connect a database via the Hasura CLI or API

<Tabs groupId="user-preference" className="api-tabs">
<TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

In your `config v3` project, head to the `/metadata/databases/databases.yaml` file and add the database configuration as
below. If you're using the HASURA_GRAPHQL_DATABASE_URL env var then the database will get automatically added and named 
default.

```yaml
- name: <db_name>
  configuration:
    connection_info:
      database_url:
        from_env: <DB_URL_ENV_VAR>
      pool_settings:
        idle_timeout: 180
        max_connections: 50
        retries: 1
    tables: []
    functions: []
```

Apply the Metadata by running:

```bash
hasura metadata apply
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="api" label="API">

Depending on the type of database, you can add a database using the
[sources Metadata API](/api-reference/metadata-api/source.mdx).

For example:

```http
POST /v1/metadata HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
X-Hasura-Role: admin

{
  "type": "pg_add_source",
  "args": {
    "name": "<db_name>",
    "configuration": {
      "connection_info": {
        "database_url": {
          "from_env": "<DB_URL_ENV_VAR>"
        },
        "pool_settings": {
          "retries": 1,
          "idle_timeout": 180,
          "max_connections": 50
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info On-the-fly connecting and removing of databases

In versions `v2.0.0` and above, databases can be connected and removed dynamically without having to restart the Hasura
Engine instance.

:::

## Connecting different Hasura instances to the same database

You can connect different Hasura instances (i.e. instances with different Metadata) to the same database as long as
there are no [Event Triggers](/event-triggers/index.mdx) in any of the Metadata. Event Triggers store their data in the
underlying database and hence different instances acting on the same data can cause undefined behavior during
run-time. This should not be a problem if the Hasura instances have the same Metadata.

To connect multiple Hasura instances to the same database, simply follow the steps above for
[Connect to an existing database](#connect-to-an-existing-database) for each instance.

## Connecting to a database not exposed over the internet

## More databases

Support for more databases is coming soon. Stay up to date with
[supported databases here](/databases/index.mdx#supported-databases).
