# Get Started with Hasura Cloud and Snowflake

## Try it out

### Step 1: Create an account on Hasura Cloud and create a new Hasura Project

Navigate to
[cloud.hasura.io](https://cloud.hasura.io/signup/?pg=docs&plcmt=body&cta=navigate-to-cloud-hasura-io&tech=default), and
create a new Hasura Cloud account.

Once you create a project on Hasura Cloud, hit the "Launch Console" button to open the Hasura Console for your project.

### Step 2: Add your Snowflake database as a source to Hasura

:::info Note

** Step 2 Prerequisite: Turn on the experimental features for GDC**.

While the Snowflake Connector is in beta, the feature can only be enabled by turning on the _Experimental features
for GDC_ under the _Feature Flags_ section of the Console configuration page.

1) Click the gear icon in the top-right corner of your Cloud project <br/>
2) In the side navigation, click "Feature Flags" <br/>
3) Finally, toggle the "Experimental features for GDC" switch to enable <br/>

:::

Head to the `Data > Manage databases` section on the Console to add your Snowflake database as a source to Hasura.

:::info Make sure your Snowflake service is reachable by Hasura Cloud:

1.  **Allow public connections or
    [whitelist the Hasura Cloud IP](/projects/create.mdx#cloud-projects-create-allow-nat-ip) on your Snowflake
    firewall:** This is good for testing and will allow you to quickly try out Hasura with your database!
2.  **VPC peering:** VPC peering and private network access is available on Hasura Cloud paid tiers and is
    recommended for production. Get in touch with us if you'd like to try this out against your existing databases.

:::

#### Step 2.1: Begin by clicking "Connect Database"

#### Step 2.2: Next, choose the `snowflake (Beta)` driver

#### Step 2.3: Enter your Snowflake database URL

  alt='Setting the Snowflake connection details.'
  width='1000px'
/>

Once you add the Snowflake service, you will find it listed as an available database on the sidebar.

### Step 3: Track existing tables

To query your Snowflake service using Hasura, you'll need to have existing tables to select. Those tables
will appear under the database as shown.

You can select all or select individual tables to track.  Click "Track Selected" for Hasura to introspect them and
create the corresponding GraphQL schema.

### Step 4: Try out a GraphQL query

Head to the `API` tab in the Console and try running a GraphQL query! Use the explorer sidebar on GraphQL to get help in
creating a GraphQL query.
