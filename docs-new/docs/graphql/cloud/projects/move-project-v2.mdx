# Updating Hasura Cloud v1.3 projects to Hasura v2.0

## Introduction

Hasura Cloud now creates new projects with Hasura `v2.0` by default. Due
to some behaviour and underlying architectural changes in `v2.0`,
existing projects have not been auto-updated to `v2.0`. You can update
your older `v1.3` projects to `v2.0` by following this guide.

(*You can find the older guide to do this process manually*
[here](/graphql/cloud/projects/move-project-v2-manual.mdx))

:::info Note

In case you happen to have a large number of past cron and event trigger
logs in your database, this might slow down the update to v2 and might
even cause DB errors in certain scenarios.

**It is highly recommended to clean up past cron and event trigger logs
data from the database before attempting the update if you have a lot of
historical data.**

You can take a dump of this data before cleaning up if you wish to keep
the log history.

:::

## What has changed?

Check the [core updating to v2.0 guide](/graphql/core/guides/upgrade-hasura-v2.mdx) and the
[release notes](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/releases) to
see what new concepts, features and behaviour changes have been
introduced in Hasura `v2.0`.

Note that Hasura v2 Cloud projects' metadata is now stored in metadata
DBs managed by Hasura Cloud. Hence the new
`HASURA_GRAPHQL_METADATA_DATABASE_URL` env var is not configurable on
Hasura Cloud and is managed by Hasura Cloud itself.

See the section on [hasura_v1_v2_compatibility](/graphql/core/guides/upgrade-hasura-v2.mdx#hasura-v1-v2-compatibility) to use a Hasura v2 Cloud
project like a Hasura v1 Cloud project.

## Estimated time needed for update

Depending on the size of your project the update process should
typically take around **5-10 minutes** to be completed.

## Project availability during update

During the update process Hasura Cloud will need to place your project
in a "Maintenance mode" till the process is complete.

When **Cloud maintenance mode** is enabled, all Hasura Cloud project
actions such as updating env vars, transferring ownership, etc. will be
disabled.

When **Server maintenance mode** is enabled, all actions updating the
project metadata such as tracking tables, adding relationships, etc.
will be disabled.

Hence it is recommended to update your project at a time convenient to
all project collaborators.

Apart from the brief moments needed to enable/disable the server
maintenance mode, **your GraphQL API will continue to function during
this period.**

## Post-update steps

-  As with most major updates, we would recommend you to monitor and
    ensure all functionalities of your project are working as expected
    post the update and the update did not cause any unexpected changes.
    Do get in touch with us in case you notice anything unexpected.
-  You can choose to unset the
    `HASURA_GRAPHQL_V1_BOOLEAN_NULL_COLLAPSE` env var that was added to
    your project during the update to preserve a `v1.3` behaviour that
    was modified in `v2.0`. [See details](/graphql/core/guides/upgrade-hasura-v2.mdx#hasura-v2-null-where-change).
    We recommend moving to the new behaviour by unsetting the env var
    after verifying your project is not impacted by the change.
-  Check the [Post update steps](/graphql/core/guides/upgrade-hasura-v2.mdx#hasura-v1-to-v2-post-update-steps)
    section of the core updating to v2.0 guide for other changes you
    should make post your project update.

## Update process

:::info Update option might not be currently enabled for all users

If you do not see the option to update your project as mentioned below, please reach out to support.

:::

To start the update, you should see a button called `Update` next to
your project on the Project list page as shown below:

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/graphql/cloud/projects/update-project.png"
  alt="Update project"
  width="700px"
/>

Clicking on this button will trigger an update job that will perform a
few tasks to update your current `v1.3` project to `v2.0`.

Refer to the following task wise breakdown of the update job to
understand what the job will be doing and to check your project end
state in case of any failures.

Do reach out to support if you observe any issues with the update
process or run into any other problems post the v2.0 update.

### Update job sub-tasks

The following is a task wise breakdown of the update to v2.0 job.

Each task in the update job has a **rollback strategy** in case any
failures occur. If the rollback steps of any task fail, the project
might be in an unhealthy state in which case please get in touch with
support immediately for assistance.

#### Step 1: Initializing

##### Step 1.1: Validating

###### Sub-tasks:

-  Enable cloud maintenance mode
-  Ensure infrastructure for update is available

###### On Failure:

-  Disable cloud maintenance mode
-  **Project stays in v1.3**

##### Step 1.2: Enabling maintenance mode

###### Sub-tasks:

-  Set `HASURA_GRAPHQL_ENABLE_MAINTENANCE_MODE` env var to enable
    server maintenance mode
-  Set `HASURA_GRAPHQL_V1_BOOLEAN_NULL_COLLAPSE` env var to `true` to
    maintain `v1.3` behaviour for `null` values in `where` filters.
    [(Know more)](/graphql/core/guides/upgrade-hasura-v2.mdx#hasura-v2-behaviour-changes)

###### On Failure:

-  Unset `HASURA_GRAPHQL_V1_BOOLEAN_NULL_COLLAPSE` env var
-  Unset `HASURA_GRAPHQL_ENABLE_MAINTENANCE_MODE` env var to disable
    server maintenance mode
-  Disable cloud maintenance mode
-  **Project stays in v1.3**

#### Step 2: Updating project

##### Step 2.1: Migrating project metadata

###### Sub-tasks:

-  Take a backup of server metadata from user database & move metadata
    to cloud metadata database

###### On Failure:

-  Unset `HASURA_GRAPHQL_V1_BOOLEAN_NULL_COLLAPSE` env var
-  Unset `HASURA_GRAPHQL_ENABLE_MAINTENANCE_MODE` env var to disable
    server maintenance mode
-  Disable cloud maintenance mode
-  **Project stays in v1.3**

##### Step 2.2: Creating v2.0 instance

###### Sub-tasks:

-  Create `v2.0` instance
-  Start routing requests to `v2.0` instance

###### On Failure:

-  Start routing requests back to `v1.3` instance
-  Unset `HASURA_GRAPHQL_ENABLE_MAINTENANCE_MODE` env var to disable
    server maintenance mode
-  Disable cloud maintenance mode
-  **Project stays in v1.3**

##### Step 2.3: Migrating pending events, async actions data

###### Sub-tasks:

-  Send signal to shutdown `v1.3` instance
-  Wait for `v1.3` to gracefully shutdown after completing processing
    of any in-flight events
-  Migrate pending events, async actions data to cloud metadata
    database

###### On Failure:

-  Restart `v1.3` instance
-  Start routing requests back to `v1.3` instance
-  Unset `HASURA_GRAPHQL_ENABLE_MAINTENANCE_MODE` env var to disable
    server maintenance mode
-  Disable cloud maintenance mode
-  **Project stays in v1.3**

##### Step 2.4: Migrating processed events, async actions data {#v2-update-migrate-invocation-logs}

###### Sub-tasks:

-  Migrate invocation logs of processed events, async actions to cloud
    metadata database

###### On Failure:

-  **No action taken. Job continues to next task**
-  Invocation logs of already processed events, async actions are not
    migrated. Contact support to assist with a manual migration of the
    logs if needed

#### Step 3: Validating update

##### Step 3.1: Disabling maintenance mode {#v2-update-disable-maintenance-mode}

###### Sub-tasks:

-  Unset `HASURA_GRAPHQL_ENABLE_MAINTENANCE_MODE` env var to disable
    server maintenance mode
-  Disable cloud maintenance mode

###### On Failure:

-  **No action taken. Job continues to next task**
-  Server maintenance mode can be disabled manually by setting
    `HASURA_GRAPHQL_ENABLE_MAINTENANCE_MODE` env var to `false`
-  Contact support if your project is in an unexpected state

##### Step 3.2: Check metadata consistency {#v2-update-check-consistency}

###### Sub-tasks:

-  Check if metadata is consistent

###### On Failure:

-  **No action taken. Job continues to next task**
-  Check your project metadata status on the console *(Settings (âš™) ->
    Metadata status)* and attempt reloading metadata if there is an
    unexpected inconsistency reported. Contact support if the
    inconsistency doesn't go away on metadata reload.

#### 4. Project update complete

Project update to `v2.0` is completed.
