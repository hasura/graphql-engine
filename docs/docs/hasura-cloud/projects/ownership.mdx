# Transfer Project Ownership

## Introduction

You can transfer ownership of your project to another user. After the ownership is transferred successfully, the
original owner will lose all access to the project.

:::info Note

If the project is on the `Standard` or `Professional` (pay-as-you-go) tier, the new owner will pay for the entire data
usage for the month in which the ownership is transferred.
