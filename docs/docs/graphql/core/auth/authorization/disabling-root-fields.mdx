# Disabling root fields

## Introduction

When you track a table in Hasura, by default it exposes all the root fields available to the role. However,
sometimes you may want a role to only have access to certain root fields of a table or have the table be accessible
only through [relationships](/graphql/core/databases/postgres/schema/table-relationships/index.mdx).

:::info Note

Only query and subscription root fields can be disabled.

:::

:::tip Supported from

Disabling root fields is supported in version `v2.8.0` and above.

## Use cases

### 1. Allow a table to be accessible only through a relationship

Let's say we have two tables, `authors` and `articles` defined as follows:

| Table    | Columns                                                                       | Hasura relationships |
|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| author   | `id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `created_at`, `is_active`                    | articles (array)     |
| articles | `id`, `author_id`, `title`, `content`, `created_at`, `is_public`              | author (object)      |

We would like to configure permissions of the `guest` role such that they are only able to access the `articles` of the
`authors` which they can access i.e. access the `articles` table only through the `authors` -> `articles` relationship.

Modifying the select permission of the `articles` table:

```http
POST /v1/metadata HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
X-Hasura-Role: admin

{
  "type" : "pg_create_select_permission",
  "args" : {
    "table" : "article",
    "role" : "guest",
    "source": "default",
    "permission" : {
      "columns" : "*",
      "filter" : {
        "is_public": true
      },
      "query_root_fields": [],
      "subscription_root_fields": []
    }
  }
}
```

With this the `guest` role is allowed to select all columns and rows
where `is_public` is set to `true` in the `articles` table. Note that
`query_root_fields` and `subscription_root_fields` are set to `[]`,
which means that the `guest` role won't be able to access the `articles`
table directly, but will be able to access it through the `articles` relationship.

:::caution

If root fields are disabled then you may try to simplify the row filter permissions
by giving it "all rows" but you should be cautious here because the field may be
accessible through a different type e.g. `returning` field in a mutation output type.

### 2. Access only via primary key

Let's say you want to allow a client to fetch data from a table only if the client knows the primary key of a row in
that table.

In this case, regardless of the permission on the table, only `<table>_by_pk` should be exposed in `query_root`.

This can be done in the following way:

```http
POST /v1/metadata HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
X-Hasura-Role: admin

{
  "type" : "pg_create_select_permission",
  "args" : {
    "table" : "article",
    "role" : "user",
    "source": "default",
    "permission" : {
      "columns" : "*",
      "filter" : {},
      "query_root_fields": ["select_by_pk"],
      "subscription_root_fields": ["select_by_pk"]
    }
  }
}
```


### 3. Disable subscription fields

You can allow a role to only be able to make query and not subscription requests.

This can be done in the following way:

```http
POST /v1/metadata HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
X-Hasura-Role: admin

{
  "type" : "pg_create_select_permission",
  "args" : {
    "table" : "article",
    "role" : "user",
    "source": "default",
    "permission" : {
      "columns" : "*",
      "filter" : {},
      "subscription_root_fields": []
    }
  }
}
```

The _absence_ of `query_root_fields` here signifies we want all the available query root fields to be exposed.
