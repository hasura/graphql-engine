The following issues were raised but disallowed by compatibility configuration:

The field 'departments' in object type 'institution (in subgraph default)' cannot be mapped to data connector 'custom (in subgraph default)' field 'institution.departments' because: Type '[String]!' is not compatible with NDC type 'Array { element_type: Named { name: TypeName("String") } }' - Expected a nullable type
