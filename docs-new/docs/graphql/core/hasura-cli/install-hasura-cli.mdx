Linux

In your Linux shell, run the following command:

```bash
curl -L https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/raw/stable/cli/get.sh | bash
```

This will install the Hasura CLI in `/usr/local/bin`. You might have to
provide your `sudo` password depending on the permissions of your
`/usr/local/bin` location.

If you'd prefer to install to a different location other than
`/usr/local/bin`, set the `INSTALL_PATH` variable accordingly:

```bash
curl -L https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/raw/stable/cli/get.sh | INSTALL_PATH=$HOME/bin bash
```

You can also install a specific version of the CLI by providing the
`VERSION` variable:

```bash
curl -L https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/raw/stable/cli/get.sh | VERSION=v2.1.1 bash
```

Windows

Download the binary `cli-hasura-windows-amd64.exe` available under
`Assets` of the latest release from the GitHub release page:
<https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/releases>

Rename the downloaded file to `hasura`. You can add the path to the
environment variable `PATH` for making `hasura` accessible globally.

## Install through npm

Hasura CLI is available as an npm package that is independently
maintained by some members of the community. It can be beneficial to use
the npm package if you want a version-fixed cli dedicated to your
node.js project. You can find usage details (e.g. flag information) in
the [original repository](https://github.com/jjangga0214/hasura-cli).

```bash
# install as a devDependency of your project
npm install --save-dev hasura-cli[@tag|@version]

# or install globally on your system
npm install --global hasura-cli[@tag|@version]
```

## (Optional) Add shell completion

To add command auto completion in the shell, refer to
`hasura completion <hasura_completion>`.
