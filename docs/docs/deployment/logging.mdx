## Different log-types {#log-types}

The Hasura GraphQL engine has different kind of log-types depending on the sub-system or the layer. A log-type is simply
the `type` field in a log line, which indicates which sub-system the log comes from.

For example, the HTTP webserver logs incoming requests as an access log and is called `http-log`. Similarly logs from
the websocket layer are called `websocket-log`, logs from the event trigger system are called `event-trigger` etc.

You can configure the GraphQL engine to enable/disable certain log-types using the the `--enabled-log-types` flag or the
`HASURA_GRAPHQL_ENABLED_LOG_TYPES` env var. See
[GraphQL Engine server config reference](/deployment/graphql-engine-flags/reference.mdx)

Default enabled log-types are: `startup, http-log, webhook-log, websocket-log, jwk-refresh-log`

All the log-types that can be enabled/disabled are:

| Log type          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Log Level          |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `startup`         | Information that is logged during startup                                                                                                                                                                                         | `info`             |
| `query-log`       | Logs: the entire GraphQL query with variables, generated SQL statements (only for database queries, not for mutations/subscriptions or remote schema and action queries), the operation name (if provided in the GraphQL request) | `info`             |
| `http-log`        | Http access and error logs at the webserver layer (handling GraphQL and metadata requests)                                                                                                                                        | `info` and `error` |
| `websocket-log`   | Websocket events and error logs at the websocket server layer (handling GraphQL requests)                                                                                                                                         | `info` and `error` |
| `webhook-log`     | Logs responses and errors from the authorization webhook (if setup)                                                                                                                                                               | `info` and `error` |
| `jwk-refresh-log` | Logs information and errors about periodic refreshing of JWK                                                                                                                                                                      | `info` and `error` |

Configurable log-types

Apart from the above, there are other internal log-types which cannot be configured:

| Log type             | Description                                                                                         | Log Level          |

| `pg-client`          | Logs from the postgres client library                                                               | `warn`             |
| `metadata`           | Logs inconsistent metadata items                                                                    | `warn`             |
| `telemetry-log`      | Logs error (if any) while sending out telemetry data                                                | `info`             |
| `event-trigger`      | Logs HTTP responses from the webhook, HTTP exceptions and internal errors                           | `info` and `error` |
| `ws-server`          | Debug logs from the websocket server, mostly used internally for debugging                          | `debug`            |
| `schema-sync-thread` | Logs internal events, when it detects schema has changed on Postgres and when it reloads the schema | `info` and `error` |
| `health-check-log`   | Logs source health check events which includes health status of a data source                       | `info` and `warn`  |

Internal log-types

## Logging levels

You can set the desired logging level on the server using the `log-level` flag or the `HASURA_GRAPHQL_LOG_LEVEL` env
var. See [GraphQL Engine server config reference](/deployment/graphql-engine-flags/reference.mdx).

The default log-level is `info`.

Setting a log-level will print all logs of priority greater than the set level. The log-level hierarchy is:
`debug > info > warn > error`

For example, setting `--log-level=warn`, will enable all warn and error level logs only. So even if you have enabled
`query-log` it won't be printed as the level of `query-log` is `info`.

See [log-types](#log-types) for more details on log-level of each log-type.

## Log structure and metrics

All requests are identified by a request id. If the client sends a `x-request-id` header then that is used, otherwise a
request id is generated for each request. This is also sent back to the client as a response header (`x-request-id`).
This is useful to correlate logs from the server and the client.

### **query-log** structure

On enabling verbose logging, i.e. enabling `query-log`, GraphQL engine will log the full GraphQL query object on each
request.

It will also log the generated SQL for GraphQL queries (but not mutations and subscriptions).

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2019-06-03T13:25:10.915+0530",
  "level": "info",
  "type": "query-log",
  "detail": {
    "kind": "database",
    "request_id": "840f952d-c489-4d21-a87a-cc23ad17926a",
    "query": {
      "variables": {
        "limit": 10
      },
      "operationName": "getProfile",
      "query": "query getProfile($limit: Int!) {\n  profile(limit: $limit, where: {username: {_like: \"%a%\"}}) {\n    username\n  }\n  myusername: profile (where: {username: {_eq: \"foobar\"}}) {\n    username\n  }\n}\n"
    },
    "generated_sql": {
      "profile": {
        "prepared_arguments": ["{\"x-hasura-role\":\"admin\"}", "%a%"],
        "query": "SELECT  coalesce(json_agg(\"root\" ), '[]' ) AS \"root\" FROM  (SELECT  row_to_json((SELECT  \"_1_e\"  FROM  (SELECT  \"_0_root.base\".\"username\" AS \"username\"       ) AS \"_1_e\"      ) ) AS \"root\" FROM  (SELECT  *  FROM \"public\".\"profile\"  WHERE ((\"public\".\"profile\".\"username\") LIKE ($2))     ) AS \"_0_root.base\"     LIMIT 10 ) AS \"_2_root\"      "
      },
      "myusername": {
        "prepared_arguments": ["{\"x-hasura-role\":\"admin\"}", "foobar"],
        "query": "SELECT  coalesce(json_agg(\"root\" ), '[]' ) AS \"root\" FROM  (SELECT  row_to_json((SELECT  \"_1_e\"  FROM  (SELECT  \"_0_root.base\".\"username\" AS \"username\"       ) AS \"_1_e\"      ) ) AS \"root\" FROM  (SELECT  *  FROM \"public\".\"profile\"  WHERE ((\"public\".\"profile\".\"username\") = ($2))     ) AS \"_0_root.base\"      ) AS \"_2_root\"      "
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The `type` of in the log with be `query-log`. All the details are nested under the `detail` key.

This log contains 3 important fields:

- `kind`: indicates the type or kind of operation. `kind` can be `database`, `action`, `remote-schema`, `cached` or
  `introspection`
- `request_id`: A unique ID for each request. If the client sends a `x-request-id` header then that is respected,
  otherwise a UUID is generated for each request. This is useful to correlate between `http-log` and `query-log`.
- `query`: Contains the full GraphQL request including the variables and operation name.
- `generated_sql`: this contains the generated SQL for GraphQL queries. For mutations and subscriptions this field will
  be `null`.

### **http-log** structure

This is how the HTTP access logs look like:

- On success response:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2019-05-30T23:40:24.654+0530",
  "level": "info",
  "type": "http-log",
  "detail": {
    "request_id": "072b3617-6653-4fd5-b5ee-580e9d098c3d",
    "operation": {
      "query_execution_time": 0.009240042,
      "user_vars": {
        "x-hasura-role": "user"
      },
      "error": null,
      "request_id": "072b3617-6653-4fd5-b5ee-580e9d098c3d",
      "parameterized_query_hash": "7116865cef017c3b09e5c9271b0e182a6dcf4c01",
      "response_size": 105,
      "query": null
    },
    "http_info": {
      "status": 200,
      "http_version": "HTTP/1.1",
      "url": "/v1/graphql",
      "ip": "127.0.0.1",
      "method": "POST"
    }
  }
}
```

- On error response:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2019-05-29T15:22:37.834+0530",
  "level": "error",
  "type": "http-log",
  "detail": {
    "operation": {
      "query_execution_time": 0.000656144,
      "user_vars": {
        "x-hasura-role": "user",
        "x-hasura-user-id": "1"
      },
      "error": {
        "path": "$.selectionSet.profile.selectionSet.usernamex",
        "error": "field 'usernamex' not found in type: 'profile'",
        "code": "validation-failed"
      },
      "request_id": "072b3617-6653-4fd5-b5ee-580e9d098c3d",
      "response_size": 142,
      "query": {
        "variables": {
          "limit": 10
        },
        "operationName": "getProfile",
        "query": "query getProfile($limit: Int!) { profile(limit: $limit, where:{username: {_like: \"%a%\"}}) { usernamex} }"
      }
    },
    "http_info": {
      "status": 200,
      "http_version": "HTTP/1.1",
      "url": "/v1/graphql",
      "ip": "127.0.0.1",
      "method": "POST"
    }
}
```

The `type` in the log will be `http-log` for HTTP access/error log. This log contains basic information about the HTTP
request and the GraphQL operation.

It has two important "keys" under the `detail` section - `operation` and `http_info`.

`http_info` lists various information regarding the HTTP request, e.g. IP address, URL path, HTTP status code etc.

`operation` lists various information regarding the GraphQL query/operation.

- `query_execution_time`: the time taken to parse the GraphQL query (from JSON request), compile it to SQL with
  permissions and user session variables, and then executing it and fetching the results back from Postgres. The unit is
  in seconds.
- `user_vars`: contains the user session variables. Or the `x-hasura-*` session variables inferred from the
  authorization mode.
- `request_id`: A unique ID for each request. If the client sends a `x-request-id` header then that is respected,
  otherwise a UUID is generated for each request.
- `response_size`: Size of the response in bytes.
- `error`: _optional_. Will contain the error object when there is an error, otherwise this will be `null`. This key can
  be used to detect if there is an error in the request. The status code for error requests will be `200` on the
  `v1/graphql` endpoint.
- `query`: _optional_. This will contain the GraphQL query object only when there is an error. On successful response
  this will be `null`.
- `parametrized_query_hash` (\*): Hash of the incoming GraphQL query after resolving variables with all the leaf nodes
  (i.e. scalar values) discarded. This value will only be logged when the request is successful. For example, all the
  queries mentioned in the below snippet will compute the same parametrized query hash.

```graphql
# sample query
query {
  authors(where: { id: { _eq: 2 } }) {
    id
    name
  }
}

# query with a different leaf value to that of the sample query
query {
  authors(where: { id: { _eq: 203943 } }) {
    id
    name
  }
}

# query with use of a variable, the value of
# the variable `id` can be anything
query {
  authors(where: { id: { _eq: $id } }) {
    id
    name
  }
}

# query with use of a boolean expression variable,
# the value when the `whereBoolExp` is in the form of
#
#  {
#     "id": {
#       "_eq": <id>
#     }
#  }

query {
  authors(where: $whereBoolExp) {
    id
    name
  }
}
```

### **websocket-log** structure

This is how the Websocket logs look like:

- On successful operation start:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2019-06-10T10:52:54.247+0530",
  "level": "info",
  "type": "websocket-log",
  "detail": {
    "event": {
      "type": "operation",
      "detail": {
        "request_id": "d2ede87d-5cb7-44b6-8736-1d898117722a",
        "operation_id": "1",
        "query": {
          "variables": {},
          "query": "subscription {\n  author {\n    name\n  }\n}\n"
        },
        "operation_type": {
          "type": "started"
        },
        "operation_name": null
      }
    },
    "connection_info": {
      "websocket_id": "f590dd18-75db-4602-8693-8150239df7f7",
      "jwt_expiry": null,
      "msg": null
    },
    "user_vars": {
      "x-hasura-role": "admin"
    }
  }
}
```

- On operation stop:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2019-06-10T11:01:40.939+0530",
  "level": "info",
  "type": "websocket-log",
  "detail": {
    "event": {
      "type": "operation",
      "detail": {
        "request_id": null,
        "operation_id": "1",
        "query": null,
        "operation_type": {
          "type": "stopped"
        },
        "operation_name": null
      }
    },
    "connection_info": {
      "websocket_id": "7f782190-fd58-4305-a83f-8e17177b204e",
      "jwt_expiry": null,
      "msg": null
    },
    "user_vars": {
      "x-hasura-role": "admin"
    }
  }
}
```

- On error:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2019-06-10T10:55:20.650+0530",
  "level": "error",
  "type": "websocket-log",

      "msg": null
    },
    "user_vars": {
      "x-hasura-role": "admin"
    }
  }
}
```

### **health-check-log** structure

The GraphQL Engine does recurring health checks on data sources and logs the status with other
details. This is how the health check log looks like:

- On successful health check

```json
{
  "level": "info",
  "timestamp": "2022-07-28T12:23:56.555+0530",
  "type": "health-check-log",
  "detail": {
    "source_name": "mssql",
    "status": "OK",
    "timestamp": "2022-07-28T06:53:56.555Z",
    "error": null,
    "internal": {
      "interval": 5,
      "max_retries": 3,
      "retry_iteration": 0,
      "timeout": 3
    }
  }
}
```

- When health check is timed out

```json
{
  "level": "warn",
  "timestamp": "2022-07-28T12:28:16.165+0530",
  "type": "health-check-log",
  "detail": {
    "source_name": "mssql",
    "status": "TIMEOUT",
    "timestamp": "2022-07-28T06:58:16.165Z",
    "error": null,
    "internal": {
      "interval": 5,
      "max_retries": 3,
      "retry_iteration": 3,
      "timeout": 3
    }
  }
}
```

- When health check results in an error

```json
{
  "level": "warn",
  "timestamp": "2022-07-28T12:30:06.643+0530",
  "type": "health-check-log",
  "detail": {
    "source_name": "postgres",
    "status": "ERROR",
    "timestamp": "2022-07-28T07:00:06.643Z",
    "error": {
      "message": "connection error",
      "extra": "connection to server at \"localhost\" (::1), port 6432 failed: Connection refused\n\tIs the server running on that host and accepting TCP/IP connections?\nconnection to server at \"localhost\" (127.0.0.1), port 6432 failed: Connection refused\n\tIs the server running on that host and accepting TCP/IP connections?\n"
    },
    "internal": {
      "interval": 10,
      "max_retries": 3,
      "retry_iteration": 3,
      "timeout": 5
    }
  }
}
```

The `type` in the log will be `health-check-log` and details of the health check will be under `detail` key.

The `detail` field value is an object contains the following members.

| Name          | Type                       | Description                                            |
| ------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `source_name` | string                     | The name of the source                                 |
| `status`      | `HealthCheckStatus` string | The health status of the source                        |
| `timestamp`   | string                     | The timestamp in UTC when the health check is finished |
| `error`       | `HealthCheckError` value   | The details of the error                               |
| `internal`    | `Internal` object          | Internals of the health check config                   |

- **HealthCheckStatus** is a mandatory field whose values are as follows.

  | Health check status | Description                                                                          | Log level |
  | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------- |
  | `OK`                | Health check succeeded with no errors.                                               | `info`    |
  | `FAILED`            | Health check is failed maybe due to bad connection config.                           | `warn`    |
  | `TIMEOUT`           | Health check is timed out. The timeout value is specified in the healch check config | `warn`    |
  | `ERROR`             | Health check results in an exception.                                                | `warn`    |

- **HealthCheckError** contains more information about the health check exception when the status is `ERROR`.
  For other statuses the value will be `null`. The `error` object contains the following fields

  - `message`: _string_. A very brief description about the error.
  - `extra`: _any json_. Contains extra and detailed information about the error.

- **Internal** is an object contains the following fields.
  - `interval`: _int_. Health check interval in seconds.
  - `max_retries`: _int_. Maximum # of retries configured.
  - `retry_interation`: _int_. The iteration on which the health check is succeeded. In case of unsuccessful health check, the retry iteration is same as `max_retries`.
  - `retry_interval`: _int_. The retry interval in seconds.
  - `timeout`: _int_. Health check time out value in seconds.

:::info Note

The GraphQL Engine logs the health check status only when

- the `status` is not `OK`
- the previous check `status` was not `OK` and current `status` is `OK`

## Monitoring frameworks

You can integrate the logs emitted by Hasura GraphQL with external monitoring tools for better visibility as per your
convenience.

For some examples, see [Guides: Integrating with monitoring frameworks](/observability/integrations/index.mdx)
