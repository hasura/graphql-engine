# nextjs-8-serverless

> Boilerplate to get started with Next.js 8 Serverless Mode, Hasura GraphQL engine as CMS and postgres as database. 

# Tutorial

- Deploy GraphQL Engine on Hasura Cloud and setup PostgreSQL via Heroku:
  
  [![Deploy to Hasura Cloud](https://graphql-engine-cdn.hasura.io/img/deploy_to_hasura.png)](https://cloud.hasura.io/)

- Get the app URL (something like `https://<my-project-name>.hasura.app`)

- Create `author` table:
  
  Open Hasura console: visit https://<my-project-name>.hasura.app on a browser  
  Navigate to `Data` section in the top nav bar and create a table as follows:

  ![Create author table](../../gatsby-postgres-graphql/assets/add_table.jpg)

- Insert sample data into `author` table:

  ![Insert data into author table](../../gatsby-postgres-graphql/assets/insert_data.jpg)

  Verify if the row is inserted successfully

  ![Insert data into author table](../../gatsby-postgres-graphql/assets/browse_rows.jpg)

- Clone this repo:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine
  cd graphql-engine/community/sample-apps/nextjs-8-serverless/with-apollo
  ```

- Install npm modules:
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

- Open `lib/init-apollo.js` and configure Hasura's GraphQL Endpoint as follows:

  ```js

    function create (initialState) {
      return new ApolloClient({
        connectToDevTools: process.browser,
        ssrMode: !process.browser, // Disables forceFetch on the server (so queries are only run once)
        link: new HttpLink({
          uri: 'https://myapp.hasura.app/v1/graphql', // Server URL (must be absolute)
          credentials: 'same-origin' // Additional fetch() options like `credentials` or `headers`
        }),
        cache: new InMemoryCache().restore(initialState || {})
      })
    }

  ```
Replace the `uri` with your own Hasura GraphQL endpoint.

In this example, we integrate Apollo with Next by wrapping our *pages/_app.js* inside a higher-order component HOC. Using the HOC pattern we're able to pass down a central store of query result data created by Apollo into our React component hierarchy defined inside each page of our Next application.

On initial page load, while on the server and inside `getInitialProps`, we invoke the Apollo method,  [`getDataFromTree`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/features/server-side-rendering.html#getDataFromTree). This method returns a promise; at the point in which the promise resolves, our Apollo Client store is completely initialized.

- We have defined the graphql query in `components/AuthorList.js`. 

    ```graphql

    query author($skip: Int!) {
        author(offset: $skip, limit: 5) {
          id
          name
        }
        author_aggregate {
          aggregate {
            count
          }
        }  
    }

    ```

- Run the app:
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```
- Test the app
  Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app

# Serverless Mode

With Next.js 8, each page in the `pages` directory becomes a serverless lambda. To enable `serverless` mode, we add the `serverless` build `target` in `next.config.js`.

```
module.exports = {
  target: "serverless",
};
```

That's it! Now build the serverless app by running the following command:

```
npm run build
```

In the `.next` folder, you will see a `serverless` folder generated after the build. Inside that there is a `pages` folder, which will have outputs of lambda per page.

```
pages/index.js => .next/serverless/pages/index.js
pages/about.js => .next/serverless/pages/about.js
```

# Deploy to now.sh

Deploy it to the cloud with [now](https://zeit.co/now) ([download](https://zeit.co/download)):

```bash
npm install -g now
now
```
Note: Older versions of now-cli doesn't support serverless mode.
Once the deployment is successful, you will be able to navigate to pages `/` and `/about`, with each one internally being a lambda function which `now` manages.
