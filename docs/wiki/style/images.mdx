# Images and Screenshots

A picture says a thousand words. Try to use images and diagrams wherever you can if it will provide more clarity to the
user.

### Scale

- Screenshots should be captured at a browser viewport width of `1200px`. This helps keep scaling consistent.
- You can use this
  [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/window-resizer/kkelicaakdanhinjdeammmilcgefonfh?hl=en)
  to quickly set your browser viewport to `1200px`
- Don't zoom in or out.
- When placed in situ in the documentation, the text in the image of a screenshot should closely match the text size of
  the page itself.

### Cropping

- Leave `20px` blank margins in-image around all four sides for breathability of the image.
- Crop only the logical contextual area for the feature that you are referencing. For example:
  - **don't** crop the whole screen UI if you are calling attention to only one small component on the page.
  - **do** crop the whole screen UI if it is contextual to what you are referencing.
- Make sure if you are cropping a smaller area or component that the user understands where to find it and its place in
  context within their workflow.

### File Type

- Use PNGs.
- PNGs will automatically be optimized when added to the pull request

### File Name

- Include the Hasura feature and version number in the screenshot name to make it easier to check when screenshots are
  outdated.
- Name the file with this structure:
  `{{action-depicted}}_{{image-step-or-variation-number-if-needed}}_{{hasura-feature-depicted}}_{{hasura-feature-version}}.png`
- eg: `connect-database-google-cloud_step-2_console_2-7-1.png`

### Callouts, Arrows and Other Screenshot Markup

- Use hex color <pre style={{ background: `#FC336D` }}>#FC336D</pre> for all image markup.
- Use rounded corners on callout blocks.
- Arrows should be placed at 90Â° angles, not at arbitrary angles.
- Don't make arrows unnecessarily long or short.
- Use step numbering of a number in a circle. Start count from 1, not array 0 notation.
- Use the [Skitch markup app](https://evernote.com/products/skitch) if possible.

### Versioning

- Always add an `:::info Note` admonitions for new features detailing the version at which the feature is supported
  from.
- Make sure prior versions of documentation are properly kept.
