# Integrate Prometheus with Hasura EE and build a Grafana Dashboard

<ProductBadge self />

## Overview

This guide will help you set up a basic observability dashboard for Hasura using Prometheus and Grafana. We have two
approaches depending on your use case:

- **Self-hosted**: If you are running Prometheus and Grafana on your own infrastructure, follow the
  [self-hosted installation](#self-hosted-installation) instructions.
- **Containerized**: If you are running Prometheus and Grafana in a containerized environment, follow the
  [containerized installation](#containerized-installation) instructions.

## Step 1: Enable metrics endpoint

By default, the Prometheus metrics endpoint is disabled. To enable Prometheus metrics, configure the environment variable
below:

```bash
HASURA_GRAPHQL_ENABLED_APIS=metadata,graphql,config,metrics
```

Secure the Prometheus metrics endpoint with a secret:

```bash
HASURA_GRAPHQL_METRICS_SECRET=<secret>
```

```bash
curl 'http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/metrics' -H 'Authorization: Bearer <secret>'
```

:::info Configure a secret

The metrics endpoint should be configured with a secret to prevent misuse and should not be exposed over the internet.

:::

:::tip High-cardinality Labels

Starting in `v2.26.0`, Hasura GraphQL Engine exposes metrics with high-cardinality labels by default.

You can disable
[the cardinality of labels for metrics](/deployment/graphql-engine-flags/reference.mdx#enable-high-cardinality-labels-for-metrics)
if you are experiencing high memory usage, which can be due to a large number of labels in the metrics (typically more
than 10000).

## Option 1: Self-hosted installation

### Step 2: Install and configure Prometheus

#### Step 2.1: Set up the environment

You will need to create a Prometheus user and group, and a directory for Prometheus to store its data. You will also
need to create a directory for Prometheus to store its configuration files.

This section is written based on an Ubuntu/Debian installation environment. The following commands will help you prepare
your environment:

```bash
sudo groupadd -system prometheus
sudo useradd -s /sbin/nologin -system -g prometheus prometheus
sudo mkdir /var/lib/prometheus
for i in rules rules.d files_sd; do sudo mkdir -p /etc/prometheus/${i}; done
```

#### Step 2.2: Install Prometheus

The following set of commands will help you download and install Prometheus:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt -y install wget curl
mkdir -p /tmp/prometheus && cd /tmp/prometheus
curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/prometheus/prometheus/releases/latest |
grep browser_download_url | grep linux-amd64 | cut -d '"' -f 4 | wget -qi -
tar xvf prometheus*.tar.gz
cd prometheus*/
sudo mv prometheus promtool /usr/local/bin/
```

You can check to see if Prometheus is installed correctly by running the following command:

```bash
prometheus --version
```

#### Step 2.3: Connect Prometheus to Hasura

To connect Prometheus to Hasura, you will need to create a configuration file for Prometheus. The following commands
will help you do this:

```bash
sudo cp -rpf prometheus.yml /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml sudo mv consoles/ console_libraries/ /etc/prometheus/
```

Then, you'll need to edit the Prometheus configuration file (`/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml`) to include the changes
listed below:

```yaml
# my global config
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s
  evaluation_interval: 15s

# scrape_timeout is set to the global default (10s).

# Alertmanager configuration
alerting:
  alertmanagers:
    - static_configs:
        - targets:
            # - alertmanager:9093

# Load rules once and periodically evaluate them according to the global ’evaluation_interval ’.
rule_files:
  # - "first_rules.yml"
  # - "second_rules.yml"

# A scrape configuration containing exactly one endpoint to scrape:
# Here it’s Prometheus itself.
scrape_configs:
  # The job name is added as a label ‘job=<job_name>‘ to any timeseries scraped from this config.
  - job_name: 'prometheus'
    # metrics_path defaults to ’/metrics ’
    # scheme defaults to ’http ’.
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9090']
  - job_name: 'graphQL'
    metrics_path: 'v1/metrics'
    # metrics_path defaults to ’/metrics ’
    # scheme defaults to ’http ’.
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['hasura_deployment_url:8080']
```

#### Step 2.4: Set firewall rules

If you are using a firewall, you will need to set the following rules:

```bash
sudo ufw allow 9090/tcp
```

#### Step 2.5: Set up a password for Prometheus web access

To set up a password for Prometheus web access, you will need to create a hashed password. First, we'll create the YAML
file which will store the password. Inside `/etc/prometheus/`, run the following:

```bash
sudo touch web.yml
```

Then, we'll install bcrypt:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-bcrypt -y
```

Then, we'll create a hashed password via a Python script called `genpass.py` which we can store anywhere:

```python
import getpass
import bcrypt

password = getpass.getpass("password: ")
hashed_password = bcrypt.hashpw(password.encode("utf-8"), bcrypt.gensalt())
print(hashed_password.decode())
```

You can then run the script, using the command below, and enter your password when prompted:

```bash
python3 gen-pass.py
```

The output will be a hashed password. Copy this password and paste it into the `web.yml` file, as shown below:

```yaml
basic_auth_users:
  admin: ’your new hashed value ’
```

To check yourself, use `promtool` to check the configuration file:

```bash
promtool check web-config /etc/prometheus/web.yml
```

#### Step 2.6: Restart Prometheus

To restart Prometheus, run the following command:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart prometheus
```

Then, test the password by running:

```bash
curl -u admin:<YOUR_PASSWORD> http://localhost:9090/metrics
```

You should see a response similar to the one below:

```bash
# HELP go_gc_duration_seconds A summary of the GC invocation durations.
# TYPE go_gc_duration_seconds summary
go_gc_duration_seconds{quantile="0"} 0
go_gc_duration_seconds{quantile="0.25"} 0
# etc...
```

### Step 3: Install and configure Grafana

#### Step 3.1: Install Grafana

You can install Grafana by running the following commands:

```bash
wget -q -O - https://packages.grafana.com/gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -
sudo add-apt-repository "deb https://packages.grafana.com/oss/deb stable main" sudo apt update
sudo apt install grafana
sudo systemctl start grafana-server
sudo systemctl enable grafana-server
```

At this point, your Grafana server should be available at `http://<YOUR_IP_ADDRESS>:3000` where you'll find the login
screen. The default username and password are both `admin`.

:::info Change the default password

After logging in, you will be prompted to change the default password. Set your new password and login.

:::

#### Step 3.2: Create a Prometheus data source

In Grafana, from the settings icon on the sidebar, open the `Configuration` menu and select `Data Sources`. Then, click
on `Add data source` and select `Prometheus` as the type.

Then, set the appropriate URL for your Prometheus server (e.g., `http://localhost:9090`) and click `Save & Test`. If
everything is working correctly, you should see a green `Data source is working` message.

#### Step 3.3: Create a Prometheus graph

Click the graph title and select `Edit`. Then, select the `Metrics` tab and select your Prometheus data source. Then,
enter any Prometheus expression ino the `Query` field while using the `Metric` field to lookup metrics via autocomplete.

/>

:::info Formatting legend names

To format the legend names of time series, use the "Legend format" input. For example, to show only the method and
status labels of a returned query result, separated by a dash, you could use the legend format string
`{{method}} - {{status}}`.

## Option 2: Containerized installation

### Step 2: Install and configure Prometheus and Grafana

#### Step 2.1: Prepare the Prometheus configuration file

Create a file named `prometheus.yml` on your host with the following information:

```yaml
# my global config
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s # Set the scrape interval to every 15 seconds. Default is every 1 minute.
  evaluation_interval: 15s # Evaluate rules every 15 seconds. The default is every 1 minute.
  # scrape_timeout is set to the global default (10s).

# Alertmanager configuration
alerting:
  alertmanagers:
    - static_configs:
        - targets:
          # - alertmanager:9093

# Load rules once and periodically evaluate them according to the global ’evaluation_interval ’.
rule_files:
  # - "first_rules.yml"
  # - "second_rules.yml"

# A scrape configuration containing exactly one endpoint to scrape:
# Here it’s Prometheus itself.
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'prometheus'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9090']
  - job_name: 'hasura'
    metrics_path: '/v1/metrics'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['ip_address_of_hasura_installation:8080']
```

#### Step 2.2: Pull the Prometheus and Grafana Docker containers

For Prometheus, run the following command:

```bash
docker run -p 9090:9090 -v /path/to/your/local/prometheus.yml:/etc/ prometheus/prometheus.yml prom/prometheus
```

Then, for Grafana, run the following:

```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 grafana/grafana-enterprise
```

### Step 3: Configure Grafana

#### Step 3.1: Adding a Prometheus as a data source in Grafana

In Grafana, from the settings icon on the sidebar, open the `Configuration` menu and select `Data Sources`. Then, click
on `Add data source` and select `Prometheus` as the type.

Then, set the appropriate URL for your Prometheus server (e.g., `http://localhost:9090`) and click `Save & Test`. If
everything is working correctly, you should see a green `Alerting supported` message.

#### Step 3.2: Add Hasura metrics to the dashboard

Click on the `Add Panel` icon in the top-right corner of the Grafana dashboard. Then, select `Add New Panel` or
`Add New Row`.
