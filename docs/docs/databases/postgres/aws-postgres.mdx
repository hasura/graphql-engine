# Connecting Hasura to an AWS RDS Postgres Database

## Introduction

This guide explains how to connect a new or existing [AWS RDS Postgres](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/) database to a
Hasura instance, either on [Hasura Cloud](https://cloud.hasura.io?skip_onboarding=true) or via one of our
[self-hosted](/deployment/deployment-guides/index.mdx) solutions. If you're exploring AWS RDS Postgres and are
interested in migrating an existing Postgres database - such as from Heroku - check out their
[docs](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/move-to-managed/migrate-postgresql-to-amazon-rds/) before
continuing below.

:::info Note

If you plan on using Hasura Cloud, which we recommend, follow steps 1 and 2 below. If you're self-hosting a Hasura
instance and already have a project running, skip to [step 3](#create-hasura-project-aws-rds-postgres).

:::

## Step 1: Sign up or log in to Hasura Cloud

Navigate to [Hasura Cloud](https://cloud.hasura.io/signup/?pg=docs&plcmt=body&cta=navigate-to-hasura-cloud&tech=default)
and sign up or log in.

## Step 2: Create a Hasura Cloud project {#create-hasura-project-aws-rds-postgres}

On the Hasura Cloud dashboard, create a new project:

<Thumbnail src="/img/cloud-dbs/create-hasura-cloud-project.png" alt="Create Hasura Cloud project" width="1000px" />

After the project is initialized successfully, click on `Launch Console` to open the Hasura Console in your browser.

On the Hasura Console, navigate to the `Data` tab and choose `Connect Existing Database`. Hasura will prompt you for a
Postgres Database URL. We'll create this in the next step and then come back here.

<Thumbnail src="/img/cloud-dbs/existing-db-setup.png" alt="Hasura Cloud database setup" width="700px" />

## Step 3: Create a Postgres DB on AWS {#create-aws-rds-postgres-db}

:::info Note

If you have an existing Postgres database on AWS, you can skip this step and move on to
[step 4](#connect-hasura-aws-pg).

:::

Log into the [AWS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com//).

On the top left, click on `Services` and type "RDS" into the search field. Then click on `RDS`:

<Thumbnail src="/img/cloud-dbs/aws/search-for-rds.png" alt="Navigate to RDS in AWS" width="1000px" />

Click the `Create database` button:

<Thumbnail src="/img/cloud-dbs/aws/create-database.png" alt="Create database in AWS" width="1000px" />

In `Engine options`, select `Postgres` as `Engine type`:

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/cloud-dbs/aws/postgres/rds-select-postgres.png"
  alt="Select Postgres for RDS instance on AWS"
  width="600px"
/>

Scroll down to `Settings`. Now you can choose a `DB instance identifier` as a name for your database. The
`Master username` is `postgres` by default. You can change that if you have to. As for the password, you can click the
checkbox for AWS to auto-generate one for you, or you can type in a password of your choice.

<Thumbnail src="/img/cloud-dbs/aws/rds-settings.png" alt="Settings for RDS instance on AWS" width="600px" />

Scroll down and customize other database options such as `DB instance size` and `Storage`, based on your requirements.

In the `Connectivity` section, expand the `Additional connectivity configuration`. Then set `Public access` to `Yes` and
choose or add a new security group:

<Thumbnail src="/img/cloud-dbs/aws/rds-connectivity.png" alt="Connectivity for RDS instance on AWS" width="600px" />

When you're done, at the bottom, click the `Create database` button:

<Thumbnail src="/img/cloud-dbs/aws/rds-click-create.png" alt="Create RDS instance on AWS" width="700px" />

:::info Note

If you're using a database user other than the default one, make sure to give it the right
[Postgres permissions](/deployment/postgres-requirements.mdx#managed-pg-permissions).

:::

## Step 4: Allow connections to your DB from Hasura {#connect-hasura-aws-pg}

On the database dashboard, click on `Connectivity & security`. On the right, click on the security group that you
selected or added in [step 3](/databases/postgres/aws-postgres.mdx#create-aws-rds-postgres-db).

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/cloud-dbs/aws/postgres/find-security-group.png"
  alt="Find the security group on AWS RDS"
  width="1000px"
/>

Click on the security group:

<Thumbnail src="/img/cloud-dbs/aws/select-security-group.png" alt="Click on the security group" width="1000px" />

Click on `Edit inbound rules`:

<Thumbnail src="/img/cloud-dbs/aws/inbound-rules.png" alt="Edit inbound rules for AWS RDS database" width="1000px" />

Click on `Add rule`:

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/cloud-dbs/aws/add-inbound-rule.png"
  alt="Add an inbound rule for AWS RDS database"
  width="1000px"
/>

If using Hasura Cloud, from your project's dashboard, copy the Hasura Cloud IP address:

<Thumbnail src="/img/projects/hasura-cloud-ip.png" alt="Hasura Cloud IP field" width="1000px" />

:::info Note

If you're using a self-hosted solution, you'll need to determine the IP address manually depending on your hosting
service.

:::

Add the Hasura IP address that you copied:

<Thumbnail src="/img/cloud-dbs/aws/add-hasura-ip.png" alt="Add the Hasura IP for AWS RDS database" width="1000px" />

Then click `Save rules`.

## Step 5: Construct the database connection URL {#construct-db-url-aws-postgres}

The structure of the database connection URL looks as follows:

```bash
postgresql://<user-name>:<password>@<public-ip>:<postgres-port>/<db>
```

On the database dashboard, click on `Connectivity & security`:

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/cloud-dbs/aws/postgres/get-db-connection-string.png"
  alt="Construct the database connection string for AWS RDS"
  width="1000px"
/>

- `user-name`: If you have a separate database user the user name will be their name. If you didn't specify a user, the
  default user name is `postgres`.
- `password`: If you have a separate database user, use their password. Otherwise, use the password that you chose when
  creating the database.
- `public-ip`: On the screenshot above, the `Endpoint` is the public IP.
- `postgres-port`: On the screenshot above you can find it under `Port`. The default port for Postgres is `5432`.
- `db`: The DB is `postgres` by default unless otherwise specified.

## Step 6: Finish connecting the database

Back on the Hasura Console, enter the database URL that we retrieved in
[step 5](/databases/postgres/aws-postgres.mdx#construct-db-url-aws-postgres):

<Thumbnail src="/img/getting-started/connect-db-cloud.png" alt="Database setup" width="600px" />

Then click `Connect Database`.

:::info Note

For security reasons, it is recommended to set database URLs as [env vars](/hasura-cloud/projects/env-vars.mdx) and
using the env vars to connect to the databases in place of the raw database URLs.

:::

Voil√†. You are ready to start developing.

## Next steps

- You can check out our [30-Minute Hasura Basics Course](https://hasura.io/learn/graphql/hasura/introduction/) and other
  [GraphQL & Hasura Courses](https://hasura.io/learn/) for a more detailed introduction to Hasura.

- If using Hasura Cloud, you can also click the gear icon to manage your Hasura Cloud project. (e.g. add
  [collaborators](/hasura-cloud/projects/collaborators.mdx), [env vars](/hasura-cloud/projects/env-vars.mdx) or
  [custom domains](/hasura-cloud/domains.mdx)).
