# MySQL Preview (Deprecated)

## Introduction

:::danger Deprecation Notice

This version of the Hasura MySQL implementation has been **deprecated**. Check out the latest implementation
[for Docker](/databases/mysql/docker.mdx) or [Hasura Cloud](/databases/mysql/cloud.mdx).

:::


## Try it out

MySQL support can be tried out using `docker compose` and an existing MySQL database as follows:

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- An existing MySQL database

### Step 1: Get the docker-compose file

Get the Hasura MySQL preview docker compose file:

```bash
# in a new directory run
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hasura/graphql-engine/master/install-manifests/docker-compose-mysql-preview/docker-compose.yaml
# or run
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hasura/graphql-engine/master/install-manifests/docker-compose-mysql-preview/docker-compose.yaml -o docker-compose.yaml
```

### Step 2: Update MySQL config

You need to now update the `docker-compose.yaml` file with credentials for your MySQL database _(replace the values
surrounded by \<\>)_

```yaml
...
command:
 - graphql-engine
 - --mysql-host
 - <mysql-host>
 - --mysql-user
 - <mysql-user>
 - --mysql-port
 - <mysql-port>
 - --mysql-dbname
 - <mysql-dbname>
 - --mysql-password
 - <mysql-password>
 ...
```

Our [docker networking guide](/deployment/deployment-guides/docker.mdx#docker-networking) might be useful to set the
appropriate value for `mysql-host`. _(See Hasura to API)_

### Step 3: Run Hasura GraphQL Engine

The following command will run Hasura along with a Postgres database required for its functioning.

```bash
$ docker compose up -d
```

Check if the containers are running:

```bash
$ docker ps

CONTAINER ID IMAGE                 ... CREATED STATUS PORTS          ...
097f58433a2b hasura/graphql-engine ... 1m ago  Up 1m  8080->8080/tcp ...
b0b1aac0508d postgres              ... 1m ago  Up 1m  5432/tcp       ...
```

### Step 4: Try out the GraphQL API

The GraphiQL on the Hasura Console available at `http://localhost:8080/console` can be used to try out the generated
GraphQL API.

**The Hasura Console currently does not support managing the MySQL database schema**. i.e. The `Data` section of the
console will not display the MySQL tables, etc. Hence the database schema needs to be managed externally as of now.
_(support for this is coming very soon)_

See the [source PR](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/pull/5655) for more information on current limitations and
upcoming features.
