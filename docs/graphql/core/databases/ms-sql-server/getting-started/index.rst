Getting started with MS SQL Server
==================================

To try Hasura with SQL Server, you'll need your own new or existing SQL Server database.

Here are 2 ways you can get started with Hasura:

1. :ref:`Hasura Cloud <database_ms_sql_server_cloud>`: You'll need to be able to access your SQL Server database from Hasura Cloud.
2. :ref:`Docker <database_ms_sql_server_docker>`: Run Hasura with Docker and then connect your SQL Server database to Hasura.
