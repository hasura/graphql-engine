title: React Native Setup
---

## Clone the UI Boilerplate

Clone the React Native app with UI already implemented. We will add a GraphQL backend to this UI.

```
git clone git@gihub.comTODO
```

## Run the app

```
npm install
npm start
```

Install the Expo app from Playstore/AppStore and

- For Android, scan the QR code from the Expo app to open the project
- For iOS, send an email to expo link and open it in Expo app.

Once the app is up and running, let us go ahead and add GraphQL to it.
