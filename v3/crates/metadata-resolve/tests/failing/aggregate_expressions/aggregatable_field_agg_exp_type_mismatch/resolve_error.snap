Error: the aggregate expression Invoice_aggregate_exp (in subgraph default) specifies an aggregatable field 'invoiceId' of type Int4! (in subgraph default), however the aggregation expression used to aggregate that field (Int8_aggregate_exp (in subgraph default)) is for aggregating a different type: Int8 (in subgraph default)
