# Console SSO with Google Workspace

<div className="badge badge--primary heading-badge">Available on: Self-hosted Enterprise</div>

## Introduction

SSO can be configured with Google Workspace OAuth2 by setting up [Dex](https://dexidp.io/docs/) as an OAuth2 proxy.
Access can be configured for all users of a domain or just for members of certain groups.

This guide assumes you have a Hasura GraphQL Engine instance running with a valid license key. If you don't have one,
you can get a license key via a [30-day free trial](/enterprise/try-hasura-enterprise-edition.mdx) or by contacting the
[Hasura team](mailto:sales@hasura.io).

:::info Supported from

SSO for Google Workspace is supported from versions `v2.25.0` and above.

## Step 1: Configure Hasura

The table below describes the configuration options for Google Workspace SSO. Hasura GraphQL Engine will expect these
values to be set as the value of the
[`HASURA_GRAPHQL_SSO_PROVIDERS` environment variable](/deployment/graphql-engine-flags/reference.mdx/#single-sign-on-providers):

| Key                     | Example                                                                                             | Description                                                                                                                            |

| `jwt_secret.jwk_url`    | `http://dex-endpoint-from-hasura:port/dex/keys`                                                     | JWK URL that is published by dex                                                                                                       |
| `jwt_secret.issuer`     | `http://dex-endpoint-from-browser:port/dex`                                                         | Issuer that is configured with Dex, same as issuer in Dex configuration, this is typically the endpoint at which Dex can be reached at |

Using the information above as an example, you can configure the `HASURA_GRAPHQL_SSO_PROVIDERS` environment variable as
follows:

```json
[
  {
    "client_id": "dex-login",
    "admin_roles": ["hasura-admin@company.com"],
    "name": "Google Workspace Login",
    "authorization_url": "http://127.0.0.1:5556/dex/auth",
    "request_token_url": "http://127.0.0.1:5556/dex/token",
    "scope": "openid offline_access groups",
    "jwt_secret": {
      "type": "RS256",
      "jwk_url": "http://127.0.0.1:5556/dex/keys",
      "issuer": "http://127.0.0.1:5556:5556/dex",
      "claims_map": {
        "x-hasura-allowed-roles": {
          "path": "$.groups"
        },
        "x-hasura-default-role": {
          "path": "$.groups[0]"
        }
      }
    }
  }
]
```

:::info Setting environment variables

For guidance on setting environment variables or flags for Hasura GraphQL Engine, see
[server configuration](/deployment/graphql-engine-flags/index.mdx).

:::

## Step 2: Configure Dex

Your Dex configuration will need the following fields set to enable Google Workspace SSO. You can find a sample
configuration file below. This file should be saved in the `/dex` directory of your container.

### Issuer

The base path of Dex and the external name of the OpenID Connect service. This is the canonical URL that all clients
**must** use to refer to Dex. If a path is provided, Dex's HTTP service will listen at a non-root URL. This is the
public URL at which Dex is available.

Example:

```plaintext
http://dex-domain:5556/dex
```

### Static clients

This contains the `id` and `redirectURIs`. The `id` will reference the `client_id` in the Hasura configuration. The
`redirectURIs` will be the oauth callback URL of Hasura Console, which is at
`http(s)://<hasura-endpoint>/console/oauth2/callback`.

Example:

```yaml
staticClients:
  - id: dex-login
    redirectURIs:
      - 'http://localhost:8080/console/oauth2/callback'
    name: 'Dex Login'
    public: true
```

### Connectors

The connectors field is an array of objects that define the various connectors being used in the Dex configuration. Each
object in the array contains a type field that specifies the type of connector being used. Here, we'll use
`type: google` along with a series of fields that are specific to the Google connector.

```yaml
connectors:
  - type: google
    id: google
    name: Google
    config:
      issuer: https://accounts.google.com
      # Connector config values starting with a "$" will read from the environment.
      # The clientID and clientSecret are obtained through the Google Console.
      clientID: <YOUR_CLIENT_ID>.apps.googleusercontent.com
      clientSecret: <YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET>
      redirectURI: http://127.0.0.1:5556/dex/callback
      hostedDomains:
        - company.com
      groups:
        - hasura-admin@company.com
      serviceAccountFilePath: /dex/google-sa.json
      adminEmail: groups-reader@company.com
```

        - hasura-admin@company.com
      serviceAccountFilePath: /dex/google-sa.json
      adminEmail: shahidh@hasura.io
```

</details>

## Step 3: Create a Service Account and Key

To allow Dex to fetch group information from Google, you will need to configure a service account for Dex to use. This
account needs Domain-Wide Delegation and permission to access the
`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.group.readonly` API scope.

To get group fetching set up:

- Follow the [instructions ](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/v1/guides/delegation) to set up a service
  account with Domain-Wide Delegation:
  - During service account creation, a JSON key file will be created that contains authentication information for the
    service account. This needs storing in a location accessible by Dex and you will set the `serviceAccountFilePath` to
    point at it.
  - When delegating the API scopes to the service account, delegate the
    `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.group.readonly` scope and only this scope. If you delegate more
    scopes to the service account, it will not be able to access the API.
- Enable the [Admin SDK ](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library/admin.googleapis.com/).
- Add the `serviceAccountFilePath` and `adminEmail` configuration options to your Dex config.
  - `serviceAccountFilePath` should point to the location of the service account JSON key file.
  - `adminEmail` should be the email of a Google Workspace user with a minimum of the `Groups Reader (BETA)` Role
    assigned. The service account you created earlier will impersonate this user when making calls to the admin API. A
    valid user should be able to retrieve a list of groups when
    [testing the API ](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/v1/reference/groups/list#try-it).

## Step 4: Update your deployment

Finally, you'll need to configure your deployment with these changes. Here is a Docker Compose example, with the
configuration:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:15
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    ports:
      - '5432'
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgrespassword

  hasura-pro:
    image: hasura/graphql-engine:v2.25.0
    ports:
      - '8080:8080'
    depends_on:
      - postgres
    restart: always
    environment:
      HASURA_GRAPHQL_EE_LICENSE_KEY: <YOUR_EE_LICENSE_KEY>
      HASURA_GRAPHQL_ADMIN_SECRET: <YOUR_ADMIN_SECRET>
      HASURA_GRAPHQL_DATABASE_URL: postgres://postgres:postgrespassword@postgres:5432/postgres?sslmode=disable
      HASURA_GRAPHQL_ENABLE_CONSOLE: 'true'
      HASURA_GRAPHQL_DEV_MODE: 'true'
      HASURA_GRAPHQL_ENABLED_LOG_TYPES: startup,http-log,webhook-log,websocket-log,query-log
      HASURA_GRAPHQL_ENABLED_APIS: metadata,graphql,config,metrics
      HASURA_GRAPHQL_METRICS_SECRET: <YOUR_METRICS_SECRET>
      HASURA_GRAPHQL_CONSOLE_ASSETS_DIR: /srv/console-assets
      HASURA_GRAPHQL_SSO_PROVIDERS:
        '[{"client_id": "dex-login","admin_roles": ["hasura-admin@company.com"], "name": "Dex
        Login","authorization_url": "http://127.0.0.1:5556/dex/auth","request_token_url":
        "http://127.0.0.1:5556/dex/token","scope": "openid offline_access groups","jwt_secret": {"type":
        "RS256","jwk_url": "http://dex:5556/dex/keys","issuer": "http://127.0.0.1:5556/dex","claims_map":
        {"x-hasura-allowed-roles": { "path": "$.groups" },"x-hasura-default-role": { "path": "$.groups[0]" }}}}]'

  dex:
    image: dexidp/dex
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - ./dex/config.docker.yaml:/etc/dex/config.docker.yaml
      - ./dex/google-sa.json:/dex/google-sa.json
    ports:
      - '5556:5556'

volumes:
  postgres_data:
```

## Step 5: Log in

At this point, you should see a `Dex Login` option on the Hasura Console. Now, you're ready to log in with your Google
Workspace account 🎉
