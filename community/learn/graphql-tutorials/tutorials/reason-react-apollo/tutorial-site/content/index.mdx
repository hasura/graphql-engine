This course is a concise and powerful introduction to GraphQL for ReasonReact developers.

Weâ€™ve structured this course to cover fundamental concepts of both GraphQL and using GraphQL with ReasonReact, in the shortest amount of time possible. The course is light on opinions so that once you grok the fundamentals you can go on to choose your favourite tools and tailor your workflow.

## Key topics and takeways:

- GraphQL vs REST
- GraphQL queries, mutations, subscriptions
- Setting up a GraphQL client with Apollo
- Integrating GraphQL queries in your react app
- Integrating GraphQL mutations with query variables to handle form input
- Updating local state after a GraphQL mutation (form input) using Apollo cache
- Using subscriptions with a subscriptions components
- Building a real-time feed with notifications using mutations and subscriptions

## What will be building?
We will be building a realtime todo app using authenticated GraphQL APIs.

Try this deployed version of the app to see what we'll be building:

## Will this course teach ReasonReact concepts as well?
No, we will be simulating a scenario where we already have a
GraphQL API and the basic UI of a ReasonReact app built. Our task in this
scenario is to integrate the GraphQL APIs into our ReasonReact app to build
a complete and working app.

## What do I need to take this tutorial?
You need to have npm/yarn & node 8+ running.

## How long will this tutorial take?
Less than 2 hours
