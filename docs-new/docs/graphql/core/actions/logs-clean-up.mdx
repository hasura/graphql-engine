# Cleaning up async action logs

## Introduction

Hasura stores action logs of [async actions](/graphql/core/actions/async-actions.mdx) in a table
in **the "hdb_catalog" schema of the Hasura metadata database**.

As the table gets larger, you may want to prune it. You can use any of the following options to prune your logs depending on
your need.

:::caution Warning

- Deleting logs is irreversible, so be careful with these actions.
- Deleting logs while subscriptions for the response might still be
  open may result into the loss of data and `null` values been
  returned.

:::

## The table involved

There is a specific table for action logs that is managed by Hasura:

- `hdb_catalog.hdb_action_log`: This table stores all captured action logs.

## Option 1: Delete log of a particular action invocation

```sql
DELETE FROM hdb_catalog.hdb_action_log WHERE id = '<async-action-id>';
```

## Option 2: Delete all logs of a specific action

```sql
DELETE FROM hdb_catalog.hdb_action_log WHERE action_name = '<action-name>';
```

## Option 3: Delete all logs

```sql
DELETE FROM hdb_catalog.hdb_action_log;
```

## Clearing data before a particular time period

If you wish to keep recent data and only clear data before a particular time period
you can add the following time clause to your query's where clause:

```sql
-- units can be 'minutes', 'hours', 'days', 'months', 'years'
created_at < now() - interval '<x> <units>'
```

For example: to delete all logs older than 3 months:

```sql
DELETE FROM hdb_catalog.hdb_action_log WHERE created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '3 months';
```

See the [Postgres date/time functions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-datetime.html) for more details.
