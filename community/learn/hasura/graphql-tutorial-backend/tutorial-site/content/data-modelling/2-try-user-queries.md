As you are aware that Hasura gives you Instant GraphQL APIs over Postgres, it can be tested on the table that we just created.

Let's go ahead and start exploring the GraphQL APIs for `users` table.

## Mutation

Head over to Console -> GRAPHIQL tab and insert a user using GraphQL Mutations.

```graphql
mutation {
  insert_users(objects:[{id: "1", name:"Praveen"}]) {
    affected_rows
  }
}
```

Click on the `Play` button on the GraphiQL interface to execute the query.

You should get a response looking something like this:

![User Mutation](https://graphql-engine-cdn.hasura.io/learn-hasura/assets/graphql-hasura/graphql-mutation-user.png)

Great! You have now consumed the mutation query for the `users` table that you just created. Easy isn't it?

**Tip**: You can use the `Explorer` on the GraphiQL interface to generate the mutation in a few clicks. 

## Query

Now let's go ahead and query the data that we just inserted.

```graphql
query {
  users {
    id
    name
    created_at
  }
}
```

You should get a response looking something like this:

![User Query](https://graphql-engine-cdn.hasura.io/learn-hasura/assets/graphql-hasura/graphql-query-user.png)

Note that some columns like `created_at` have default values, even though you did not insert them during the mutation.

## Subscription

Let's run a simple subscription query over `users` table to watch for changes to the table.

```graphql
subscription {
  users {
    id
    name
    created_at
  }
}
```

Initially the subscription query will return the existing results in the response.

Now let's insert new data into the users table and see the changes appearing in the response.

In a new tab, Head over to Console -> DATA tab -> users -> Insert Row and insert another row.

![Insert new user](https://graphql-engine-cdn.hasura.io/learn-hasura/assets/graphql-hasura/user-insert-new-row.png)

And switch to the previous `GRAPHIQL` tab and see the subscription response returning 2 results.

![User Subscription](https://graphql-engine-cdn.hasura.io/learn-hasura/assets/graphql-hasura/graphql-subscription-user.png)

An active subscription query will keep returning the latest set of results depending on the query.
