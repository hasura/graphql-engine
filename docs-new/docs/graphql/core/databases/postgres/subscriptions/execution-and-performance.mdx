# Subscriptions execution and performance

## Introduction

Hasura Graphql Subscriptions are **live queries** executing over the
Websocket protocol to fetch near real-time data from the database.

## Execution

The Hasura GraphQL engine subscriptions are actually **live queries**,
i.e. a subscription will return the latest result of the query being
made and not the individual events leading up to the result.

Subscriptions, on start, will emit the result of the underlying query.
Subsequently, results will be emitted only if the result of the query
changes underneath (via insert/update/delete on the subscribed
resource).

### Subscription multiplexing

Hasura optimizes subscriptions by combining multiple similar
subscriptions into one SQL query and getting a single response from the
database instead of making separate SQL queries for each subscription.
Each row in the response contains the result for a different
subscription. Once Hasura gets the response from the database, it
diff-checks the individual responses and returns the result to the
clients only if there is any difference in their data.

Multiplexed live queries are further split into batches which can be
configured via `HASURA_GRAPHQL_LIVE_QUERIES_MULTIPLEXED_BATCH_SIZE`
environment variable or the `--live-queries-multiplexed-batch-size`
flag. By default this value is set to `100`.

For example, with the default value, if there are 1000 subscription
clients with similar queries, Hasura multiplexes 100 subscriptions into
1 batch and make a single SQL query to the DB for that batch. So, in
total there will be only 10 SQL queries to the DB for the 1000
subscriptions.

### Example

A practical use of subscriptions can be for tracking the live locations
of delivery agents carrying food orders in a food-ordering system.

The setup is operating with the default Hasura params of subscription
refetch interval as 1 second and multiplexed batch size as 100.

The below figure shows multiplexing in action, where the 3 similar
subscriptions differing only in the variables are batched into one SQL:

In this case, all 3 subscriptions are multiplexed into 1 batch resulting
in 1 SQL query which is run every 1 second. If there is an update in the
location, the appropriate client gets sent the updated data.

## Tuning subscription performance

### Analyze

Subscriptions can be 'Analyzed' (from the Analyze button in GraphiQl
window of Hasura console) to see the generated multiplexed SQL and its
query plan. The query plan can reveal the bottlenecks in query execution
and appropriate indexes can be added to improve performance.

In addition to these, simplifying the subscription to avoid unnecessary
joins or avoiding fetching fields which are not going to change can also
help improve performance.

### Parameters

The parameters governing the performance of subscriptions in terms of
throughput, latency and resource utilization are:

-   `HASURA_GRAPHQL_LIVE_QUERIES_MULTIPLEXED_REFETCH_INTERVAL`
    -   Time interval between Hasura multiplexed queries to the DB for
        fetching changes in subscriptions data, default = 1 sec
    -   Increasing this reduces frequency of queries to the DB thereby
        reducing the load on it and improving throughput while
        increasing the latency of updates to the clients.
-   `HASURA_GRAPHQL_LIVE_QUERIES_MULTIPLEXED_BATCH_SIZE`
    -   Number of similar subscriptions batched into a single SQL query
        to the DB, default = 100
    -   Increasing this reduces the number of SQL statements fired to
        the DB thereby reducing the load on it and improving throughput
        while increasing individual SQL execution times and hence
        latency.
    -   This value should be reduced in case the execution time of the
        SQL generated by Hasura after multiplexing is more than the
        refetch interval.
-   `HASURA_GRAPHQL_PG_CONNECTIONS`
    -   Max number of connection Hasura opens with the DB, default = 50
    -   Increasing this increases the number of connections that can be
        opened with the DB to execute queries thereby improving
        concurrency but adding load to the database. Very high number of
        concurrent connections can result in poor DB performance.

:::info Note

-   Tuning these parameters have no impact on the resource utilization
    of Hasura. Hasura's CPU and memory utilization depends on the number
    of requests being served.
-   For most use cases, the default values offer reasonable trade-off
    between resource utilization and performance. For scenarios with
    heavy queries and high number of active subscriptions, the setup
    needs to be benchmarked and these parameters need to be iterated
    upon to achieve optimal performance.
