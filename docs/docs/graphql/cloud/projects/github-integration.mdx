# GitHub Deployment

## Introduction

GitHub integration is intended to improve the CI/CD experience on Hasura
Cloud. With GitHub integration, you can link a GitHub repository and a
branch to a Hasura Cloud project and automatically deploy metadata and
migrations in a given directory to the linked project.

Check out our [Starter
Kit](https://github.com/hasura/github-integration-starter) to see a few
example workflows.

:::info Under preview

This feature is currently available for preview. Enhancements to it will
continue to be made over the coming days. To try it out you can ask for
early access to the feature from the Hasura Cloud dashboard.

Please do share any feedback you may have regarding any improvements or
extra capabilities that you would like to see in this feature by raising
an issue/discussion on our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine).

## Deployment modes

### Automatic Deployment Mode

With the `Automatic deployment mode`, Hasura Cloud automatically
triggers a deployment for every commit pushed to the GitHub repository
from the given branch and directory.

/>

The Automatic deployment mode also has the `Deploy Now` button which
allows the user to retry deploying the latest commit.

### Manual Deployment Mode

With `Manual deployment mode`, Hasura Cloud does not automatically
deploy the commits pushed to the configured branch. The deployment of
the latest commit in that branch can be triggered manually by clicking
the `Deploy Now` button.

## Initial setup

### Link GitHub account to a Hasura Cloud project

To link a GitHub account, click on the `Sign in with GitHub` button in
the Git Deployment section of the project details.

  alt="Link GitHub Account"
  width="900px"
/>

When you link a new GitHub account, Hasura Cloud installs the Hasura
Cloud GitHub App on your GitHub account. While authenticating, you can
choose to grant access to all repositories or to specific repositories
only.

  alt="GitHub grant access"
  width="500px"
/>

The permissions requested by Hasura Cloud can be viewed in the GitHub
app settings once you install the app.

Once linked, the GitHub account with the granted scope becomes available
to all the admins on the project as the session is used to manage the
GitHub integration from the UI.

### Integrate GitHub repo with a Hasura Cloud project

Specify the GitHub repository, branch and the hasura-project directory
in the form as shown below.

<Thumbnail

  alt="Setup GitHub Integration"
  width="900px"
/>

If the repository that you're looking for doesn't show up in the
repository list, click `Configure Hasura Cloud on GitHub` to grant
access to the required repository.

Clicking on the `Setup Git Deployment` button integrates the specified
GitHub repository, branch and directory with the Hasura Cloud project.
The details for the integration can be viewed in the `Git Deployment`
section of project details.

## Deployment Process

Once a commit deployment is triggered, the progress for a commit can be
tracked by clicking on the `View Logs` button in the Deployment Log
section.

Refer to the following task wise breakdown of the deployment job to
understand what the job will be doing.

Check the troubleshooting section below and do reach out to support if
you observe any issues with the deployment process or run into any other
problems post the deployment.

### Deployment sub-tasks

The following is a task wise breakdown of the commit deployment job.

Each task in the deployment has realtime logs and can be viewed by
clicking on the `Logs` option for each successful/failed step.

#### Step 1: Fetching Metadata / Migrations

The metadata and migrations are fetched from the GitHub repository and
validated.

#### Step 2: Applying Metadata

The metadata in the GitHub repository is applied to the server.

#### Step 3: Applying Migrations

The migrations in the GitHub repository are applied to your data
sources.

#### Step 4: Finalizing Update

The metadata on the server is reloaded and project health is verified
before finalizing the update.

## Things to check before running your first deployment {#github-integration-pre-checks}

You need to ensure the your Cloud project has been appropriately set up
to execute the deployment.

-  Ensure all the required Hasura config related and any other custom
    ENV vars that might be used in the metadata are added to your Cloud
    project as well.
-  Ensure that you have connected the required database(s) with the
    right name and connection params as you have in the metadata to the
    Cloud project.

## Troubleshooting Failures {#github-integration-troubleshooting}

If a deployment fails, depending on the kind of error, you can fix it by
retrying the deployment by either updating your metadata and migrations
with a fix and pushing a commit to deploy again or by just redeploying
the failed commit after making any required fixes to your project.

The following are some troubleshooting steps to fix some possible errors
in the deployment sub-tasks:

### Error parsing metadata

-  Nothing has been modified on your project yet so there will be no
    service impact.
-  Typically happens due to some issue with the metadata directory
    structure or the format of the metadata files.
-  Check the reported error message and fix the issues in the metadata.
    See [metadata format](/graphql/core/migrations/reference/metadata-format.mdx).
-  Push the fix to GitHub to redeploy.

### Error parsing migrations

-  Nothing has been modified on your project yet so there will be no
    service impact.
-  Typically happens due to some issue with the migration directory
    structure or the format of the migration files.
-  Check the reported error message and fix the issues in the
    migrations. See [migrations format](/graphql/core/migrations/reference/migration-file-format.mdx).
-  Push the fix to GitHub to redeploy.

### Error applying metadata

-  Nothing has been modified on your project yet so there will be no
    service impact.
-  Typically happens due to some invalid metadata (e.g. due to type
    mismatches, missing required keys, etc.) trying to be applied.
-  Check the reported error message and fix the issues in the metadata.
    See [metadata format](/graphql/core/migrations/reference/metadata-format.mdx).
-  Push the fix to GitHub to redeploy.

### Error applying migrations

-  As your metadata has already been applied but applying your
    migrations have failed, your project might be in an unhealthy state.
    If your migrations and metadata had only incremental changes, i.e.
    no existing objects were modified, you likely won’t have any service
    impact because existing parts of your metadata are likely to be
    still valid and your existing functionality will be working as it
    were.
-  Look at the underlying database error. Make the appropriate fix
    depending on the error and redeploy.
-  Some common errors:
    -  <em>source with name “default” is inconsistent</em>

        In this situation, most likely either the target project doesn't
        have the required database connected or the ENV VARS or the
        database name used to connect the database is not matching in
        your source and target projects.

        To fix this, use the same ENV VARS and connect the database with
        the same name in both your projects.

    -  `“relation '<some-object>' already exists”`

        In such situations when you get errors of tables or other
        objects already existing, this might be because the migration
        might have been already applied on the database and the project
        was not yet aware of it.

        To fix this, use the Hasura CLI command
        `hasura migrate apply --skip-execution --version <migration_version> --endpoint "<cloud_project_endpoint>"`
        to mark the migration as already applied on the project. Then
        redeploy the failed commit to continue with further steps.

### Inconsistent metadata after finalizing update

-  It is possible your project might be in an unhealthy state depending
    on which metadata objects are inconsistent and what migrations were
    applied. If your metadata and migrations had only incremental
    changes, i.e. no existing objects were modified, you likely won’t
    have any service impact because existing parts of your metadata are
    likely to be still valid and your existing functionality will be
    working as it were.
-  Check the logs under `Applying Migrations` and `Finalizing Update`.
-  In the situation that the applied metadata applied was indeed
    incorrect, fix the metadata and push a new commit to redeploy.
-  If objects depending on upstream services are inconsistent, e.g.
    remote schemas, the upstream service might be unavailable or
    inconsistent. In this case please fix them and redeploy the commit.
-  If database objects are inconsistent with errors such as <em>Inconsistent object: no such table/view exists in
    source: `<table-name>`</em>, it could be because:
    -  a migration might have been skipped as the project believes its
        already been applied though its not the case. To fix it, mark
        the migration as unapplied using the following Hasura CLI
        command
        `hasura migrate delete --version <migration_version> --server --database-name <database-name> --endpoint <cloud_project_endpoint>`
        and redeploy the commit.
    -  a migration to create the database objects might be missing
        completely. To fix this create a new migration for creation of
        the missing objects and push a new commit to redeploy.
-  A rollback can be done to the previous functioning state of metadata
    by reverting your metadata changes on your branch and then pushing
    to redeploy.
