# Rolling back applied migrations (config v2)

## Introduction

If there are any issues with changes made to the DB schema and Hasura
metadata it is possible to roll back their state to a previous stable
version.

:::info Note

For `config v3`, see [Rolling back applied migrations (config v3)](/graphql/core/migrations/advanced/rolling-back-migrations.mdx).

:::

## Rolling back database schema

Database schema rollbacks can be achieved via the `down` migrations
generated every time a schema change is made.

Here are some example scenarios:

To roll back a particular migration version:

```bash
hasura migrate apply --version 1550925483858 --type down
```

To roll back the last 2 migration versions:

```bash
hasura migrate apply --down 2
```

:::info Note

Rollbacks will only work if there are `down` migrations defined for a
schema change.

e.g. The console will not generate `down` migrations for SQL statements
executed from the `SQL` tab.

## Rolling back Hasura metadata

As Hasura metadata is managed via snapshots of the metadata, to roll
back Hasura metadata to a particular state you need the metadata
snapshot at that point. This is typically achieved by marking stable
checkpoints of a project in version control via commits.

```bash
git checkout <stable-feature-commit>

hasura metadata apply
```
