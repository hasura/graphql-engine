# Event Triggers

## Introduction

Hasura can be used to create event triggers on tables in the Postgres database. Event triggers reliably capture events on specified tables and invoke webhooks to carry out any custom logic.

Events can be of the following types:

-   INSERT: When a row is inserted into a table
-   UPDATE: When a row is updated in a table
-   DELETE: When a row is deleted from a table
-   MANUAL: Using the console or API, an event can be triggered manually
    on a row

:::info Note

Event webhook notifications will be delivered at least once, and may arrive out of order with respect to the underlying event.
