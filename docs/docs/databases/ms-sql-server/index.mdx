# MS SQL Server

## Introduction

Hasura allows connecting to a SQL Server database and build a GraphQL API based on the database schema.

:::tip Supported versions:

1.  Hasura GraphQL engine `v2.0.0-alpha.2` onwards
2.  SQL Server 2016 and upwards

:::

## Get Started

To try Hasura with SQL Server, you'll need your own new or existing SQL Server database.

Here are 2 ways you can get started with Hasura and SQL Server:

1.  [Hasura Cloud](/databases/ms-sql-server/getting-started/cloud.mdx): You'll need to be able to access your SQL Server
    database from Hasura Cloud.
2.  [Docker](/databases/ms-sql-server/getting-started/docker.mdx): Run Hasura with Docker and then connect your SQL
    Server database to Hasura.

## Supported features

Hasura currently supports queries, subscriptions, mutations, relationships and permissions on MS SQL Server.

Next up on our roadmap for Hasura + SQL Server:

- Support for stored procedures & custom functions ([#7073](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/issues/7073))
- Event triggers: Trigger HTTP webhooks with atomic capture and atleast once guarantee whenever data changes inside the
  database ([#7075](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/issues/7075))
- Remote Joins: Join models in SQL Server to models from other API services (GraphQL or REST)
  ([#7076](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/issues/7076))
