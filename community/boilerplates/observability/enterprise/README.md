# Hasura Enterprise Observability Demo

An all-in-one observability demo for Hasura GraphQL Engine Enterprise Edition with Prometheus, Jaeger, Alert-manager, Node Exporter, Loki Logs and Grafana dashboards.

## Get Started

- Copy `dotenv` to `.env` and configure secrets and EE License Key.
- Try `docker-compose` locally with `docker-compose up -d`, or run the Docker Swarm stack with scripts that are in the `util` folder.

## Components

Here's a list of all the services that are created:

### Grafana Dashboards

Dashboard templates are collected in the [dashboards/hasura](grafana/dashboards/hasura) folder. You can import those files to your config folders where the Grafana service is configured, or [import them directly](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/dashboards/manage-dashboards/#import-a-dashboard) on the Grafana web UI.

### Example

The default GraphQL Engine service uses migration and metadata configuration in the [examples/hasura](./examples/hasura/) folder to invoke mock requests for metrics demonstration.

## FAQs

**How can I enable metrics in the the Source Health panel**

> Currently, only Postgres supports source health check metrics.

To enable Source Health check metrics you need to configure the [health check metadata](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/deployment/health-checks/source-health-check/#configuring-source-health-check) for each data source.


**How can I find the Trace ID of GraphQL Requests**

You can find the Trace ID in the `X-B3-TraceId` request header.
