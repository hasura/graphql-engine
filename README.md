Hasura GraphQL Engine is a blazing-fast GraphQL server that gives you **instant, realtime GraphQL APIs over Postgres**, with [**webhook triggers**](event-triggers.md) on database events for asynchronous business logic.

Hasura helps you build GraphQL apps backed by Postgres or incrementally move to GraphQL for existing applications using Postgres.

## Features

* **Make powerful queries**: Built-in filtering, pagination, pattern search, bulk insert, update, delete mutations
* **Realtime**: Convert any GraphQL query to a live query by using subscriptions
* **Trigger webhooks or serverless functions**: On Postgres insert/update/delete events ([read more](event-triggers.md))
* **Works with existing, live databases**: Point it to an existing Postgres database to instantly get a ready-to-use GraphQL API
* **Fine-grained access control**: Dynamic access control that integrates with your auth system (eg: auth0, firebase-auth)
* **High-performance & low-footprint**: ~15MB docker image; ~50MB RAM @ 1000 req/s; multi-core aware
* **Admin UI & Migrations**: Admin UI & Rails-inspired schema migrations
* **Postgres** ❤️: Supports Postgres types (PostGIS/geo-location, etc.), turns views to *graphs*, trigger stored functions or procedures with mutations

## Quickstart: 

### One-click deployment on Heroku

The fastest way to try Hasura out is via Heroku.

1. Click on the following button to deploy GraphQL Engine on Heroku with the free Postgres add-on:

    [![Deploy to Heroku](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine-heroku)

2. Open the Hasura console

   Visit `https://<app-name>.herokuapp.com` (*replace \<app-name\> with your app name*) to open the admin console.

3. Make your first GraphQL query

   Create a table and instantly run your first query. Follow this [simple guide](https://docs.hasura.io/1.0/graphql/manual/getting-started/first-graphql-query.html).

### Other deployment methods

For Docker-based deployment and advanced configuration options, see [deployment
guides](https://docs.hasura.io/1.0/graphql/manual/getting-started/index.html) or
[install manifests](install-manifests).

## Architecture

The Hasura GraphQL Engine fronts a Postgres database instance and can accept GraphQL requests from your client apps. It can be configured to work with your existing auth system and can handle access control using field-level rules with dynamic variables from your auth system.

You can also place the engine behind a central GraphQL proxy that fronts multiple GraphQL APIs via schema stitching.

## Client-side tooling

Hasura works with any GraphQL client. We recommend using [Apollo Client](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client). See [awesome-graphql](https://github.com/chentsulin/awesome-graphql) for a list of clients.

## Add business logic

### Custom resolvers

Add custom resolvers in addition to Hasura GraphQL engine. Ideal for delegating
to HTTP APIs, making direct calls to another data-source or writing business
logic in code - [read more](community/boilerplates/custom-resolvers).

### Trigger webhooks on database events

Add asynchronous business logic that is triggered based on database events.
Ideal for notifications, data-pipelines from Postgres or asynchronous
processing - [read more](event-triggers.md).
