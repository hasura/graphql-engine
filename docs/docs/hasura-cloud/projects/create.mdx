## Introduction

You can create a new Hasura Cloud Project with either a new database, or an existing database with a publicly available
IP address. For a list of supported databases and features [see here](/databases/index.mdx).

## Project setup

You can quickly and easily create a new Hasura Cloud Project. To begin, navigate to the
[Projects](https://cloud.hasura.io/projects) page on Hasura Cloud and click the "New Project" link.

This opens a form on the right where you can create your new project.

Choose a pricing plan and select a region for your project.

Once you have completed the project setup, click `Create Project`.

Once created, you can specify a new name for your Project if you want.

## Connect to a database

Once your project is created you can connect to a new or existing database. For full details on how to connect to a
database, see [connecting to a database here](/databases/connect-db/index.mdx).
