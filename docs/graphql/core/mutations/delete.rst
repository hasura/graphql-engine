Auto-generated delete mutation schema
-------------------------------------

**For example**, the auto-generated schema for the delete mutation field for a table ``article`` looks like the following:

.. code-block:: graphql

  delete_article (
    where: article_bool_exp!
  ): article_mutation_response

  # response of any mutation on the table "article"
  type article_mutation_response {
    # number of affected rows by the mutation
    affected_rows: Int!
    # data of the affected rows by the mutation
    returning: [article!]!
  }

  # single object delete (supported from v1.2.0)
  delete_article_by_pk (
    # all primary key columns args
    id: Int
  ): article

As you can see from the schema:

- The ``where`` argument is compulsory to filter rows to be deleted. See :ref:`Filter queries <filter_queries>`
  for filtering options. Objects can be deleted based on filters on their own fields or those in their nested objects.
  The ``{}`` expression can be used to delete all rows.
- You can return the number of affected rows and the affected objects (with nested objects) in the response.

See the :ref:`delete mutation API reference <delete_syntax>` for the full specifications.

.. note::

  If a table is not in the ``public`` Postgres schema, the delete mutation field will be of the format
  ``delete_<schema_name>_<table_name>``.

Delete an object by its primary key
-----------------------------------

You can delete a single object in a table using the primary key.
The output type is the nullable table object. The mutation returns the deleted
row object or ``null`` if the row does not exist.


**Example:** Delete an article where ``id`` is ``1``:

.. graphiql::
  :view_only:
  :query:
    mutation delete_an_object {
      delete_article_by_pk (
        id: 1
      ) {
        id
        title
        user_id
      }
    }
  :response:
    {
      "data": {
        "delete_article_by_pk": {
          "id": 1,
          "title": "Article 1",
          "user_id": 1
        }
      }
    }

**Example:** Delete a non-existent article:

.. graphiql::
  :view_only:
  :query:
    mutation delete_an_object {
      delete_article_by_pk (
        id: 100
      ) {
        id
        title
        user_id
      }
    }
  :response:
    {
      "data": {
        "delete_article_by_pk": null
      }
    }

.. note:: 

   ``delete_<table>_by_pk`` will **only** be available if you have select permissions on the table, as it returns the deleted row.

.. admonition:: Supported from

   The ``delete_<table>_by_pk`` mutation is supported in versions ``v1.2.0``
   and above.


Delete objects based on their fields
------------------------------------
**Example:** Delete all articles rated less than 3:

.. graphiql::
  :view_only:
  :query:
    mutation delete_low_rated_articles {
      delete_article(
        where: {rating: {_lt: 3}}
      ) {
        affected_rows
      }
    }
  :response:
    {
      "data": {
        "delete_low_rated_articles": {
          "affected_rows": 8
        }
      }
    }


Delete objects based on nested objects' fields
----------------------------------------------
**Example:** Delete all articles written by a particular author:

.. graphiql::
  :view_only:
  :query:
    mutation delete_authors_articles {
      delete_article(
        where: {author: {name: {_eq: "Corny"}}}
      ) {
        affected_rows
      }
    }
  :response:
    {
      "data": {
        "delete_authors_articles": {
          "affected_rows": 2
        }
      }
    }

Delete all objects
------------------

You can delete all objects in a table using the ``{}`` expression as the ``where`` argument. ``{}`` basically
evaluates to ``true`` for all objects.

**Example:** Delete all articles:

.. graphiql::
  :view_only:
  :query:
    mutation delete_all_articles {
      delete_article (
        where: {}
      ) {
        affected_rows
      }
    }
  :response:
    {
      "data": {
        "delete_article": {
          "affected_rows": 20
        }
      }
    }
