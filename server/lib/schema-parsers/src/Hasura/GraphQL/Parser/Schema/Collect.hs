Note [Collecting types from the GraphQL schema]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A `Parser` object consists of two things:

- a function that is used to process (part of) an incoming query, and
- a piece of GraphQL type information.

The main reason that the GraphQL type information is included is so that we can
generate responses for the introspection fields `__type` and `__schema`.  In
particular, this requires us to have a complete list of all types being used in
our schema.

When we build our schema, we therefore finish by making a full walk over the
entirety of the schema, collecting the GraphQL types encountered in a `HashMap`,
allowing us to look up GraphQL types by name.  At this point we might figure out
that a single name is used to represent two GraphQL types that are materially
distinct.  For instance, the name `author` might be used as both a GraphQL
object, representing a database table, and as a scalar, e.g. as a string name.
It also prevents us from having both

```
type author {
  id : int
  name : string
}
```

and

```
type author {
  id : int
  name : string
  email : string
}
```

in the schema, as the latter has an additional field and is thus distinct from
the former, even though it has the same name.

In fact, for HGE internally, such name clashes are not problematic.  We would
merely end up exposing illegal introspection results.  But in order to produce
introspection results, we have to explore the GraphQL schema anyway, to collect
all types.  We use this opportunity to help our users figure out whether there
are any name clashes, and if so what caused them.  So we do some work to track
where in the schema various GraphQL type names were encountered.  This type
collision information is stored in `ConflictingDefinitions`.

A typical way in which conflicting type definitions occur in practice is if one
version of HGE adds a different version of HGE as a remote schema, particularly
when support for database features was added in the meantime.  For instance, if
we'd add a new operator to boolean expressions, e.g. `XOR`, then this would end
up adding an additional field to every `<column>_bool_exp` object in our schema,
which clashes with the old `<column>_bool_exp` that's part of the remote schema.
This is not a bug of the "conflicting type definitions" logic but a limitation
of the design of HGE, which would be resolved by e.g. having namespaces for
different data sources.

{- PERFORMANCE NOTE/TODO:

Since Definition's are cyclic I spent a little time trying to optimize the
== in accumulateTypeDefinitions into a nearly-noop using pointer
equality, but could not get it to trigger unless I called it on the unlifted
ByteArray# within dName, but at that point what was a pretty small theoretical
benefit disappeared for whatever reason (plus wasn't strictly safe at that
point). (Note, to have any luck calling on Definitions directly we would need
to fix the reallocation of Definitions via @fmap TI...@ in
accumulateTypeDefinitions as well)

The TODO-flavored thing here is to investigate whether we might not have as
much sharing here as we assume. We can use ghc-debug to inspect the object in
the heap.

We might also then rewrite accumulateTypeDefinitions to return non-cyclic type
definition segmants corresponding to the equality logic here (see "dodgy"
equality comments), and even consider trying to do some kind of global
interning of these across roles (though I think that would only be an
very incremental improvement...)
