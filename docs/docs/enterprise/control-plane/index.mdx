## Introduction

Hasura EE runs 2 components:

1. The Hasura EE Data Plane: This is the Hasura GraphQL Engine that will be serving the GraphQL APIs. This data plane
   component is compatible with and is a drop-in replacement for Hasura GraphQL Engine CE that you might already be
   running.
2. The Hasura EE Control Plane: This is the control and monitoring plane for Hasura EE that enables certain features and
   allows you to manage configuration.
