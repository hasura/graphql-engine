# Monitoring Your Hasura Cloud Project

<ProductBadge pro ee />

## Introduction

Hasura Cloud now offers a new built-in observability feature, accessible from your project dashboard, allowing you to
monitor key performance metrics of your Hasura GraphQL API. This feature is designed to help you track and optimize the
performance of your project in real-time.

## Accessing the Monitoring Dashboard

To view the observability data for your project:

1. Navigate to Your Project: From the Hasura Cloud dashboard, select the project for which you want to view the monitoring data.
