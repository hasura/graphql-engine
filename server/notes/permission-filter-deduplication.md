# Permission filter deduplication

1. `T` and `U` are tables.

1. `r` is a relationship on `T` to table `U` with the join condition, `T.c =
   U.d` where `c` and `d` are columns on tables `T` and `U` respectively.

1. `s` is a relationship on `U` to table `T` with the join condition, `U.d =
   T.c`.

1. `p(T)` and `p(U)` denote the permission filters on table `T` and `U`
   respectively for some role `R`.

Consider the SQL that we generate for this query:

```
query {
  T {
    c
    r {
      d
    }
  }
}
```

It would be along these lines:

```sql
SELECT
  *
FROM
  (
    SELECT * FROM T WHERE p(T)
  ) AS T
  LEFT OUTER JOIN LATERAL
  (
    SELECT * FROM U WHERE T.c = U.d AND p(U)
  ) AS U
  ON TRUE
```

The expression `T.c = U.d` is the join condition for relationship `r`. Note
that we use lateral joins, so the join condition is not expressed using `ON`
but on the where clause of `U`.

Now, let's say `p(U)` is of the form `{ s : p(T) }`.

```sql
SELECT
  *
FROM
  (
    SELECT * FROM T WHERE p(T)
  ) AS T
  LEFT OUTER JOIN LATERAL
  (
    SELECT * FROM U WHERE T.c = U.d
    AND EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM T WHERE U.d = T.c AND p(T)
    )
  ) AS U
  ON TRUE
```

`p(U)`, i.e, `{ s : p(T) }` got expanded to

```sql
EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM T WHERE U.d = T.c AND p(T)
)
```

Now, assuming, in the `WHERE` clause for `U`, that `T.c = U.d` holds, then the
`EXISTS` clause must evaluate to true. The `EXISTS` clause must evaluate to true
because the row from `T` we are joining against is exactly such a row satisfying
`p(T)`. In other words, the row obtained from `T` (as the left-hand side of the
join) satisfies `p(T)`.
