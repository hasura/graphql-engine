Introduction
------------

The Explain API is used to analyse queries and subscriptions. It returns a list of Postgres plans for a query and a single Postgres plan for a subscription, based
on the defined permissions.

Endpoint
--------

All requests are ``POST`` requests to the ``/v1/graphql/explain`` endpoint.

API Spec
--------

Request
^^^^^^^

The request expects a JSON object with the following keys:
  - ``query``: the GraphQL query to be analysed
  - ``user`` (optional): the ``x-hasura-role`` along with session variables

.. code-block:: http

   POST /v1/graphql/explain HTTP/1.1
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
        "query": "<query>",
        "user": {
            "x-hasura-role" : "...",
            "x-hasura-session-var1" : "..."
        }
   }

Sample request
**************

.. code-block:: http

   POST /v1/graphql/explain HTTP/1.1
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
        "query": {
            "query": "query getAuthors { authors { name }}",
            "operationName": "getAuthors"
        }
   }


Response
^^^^^^^^

The response for a query is a list of plans:

.. code-block:: none

    [
        {
            "field": String -- "name of the field",
            "sql": String -- "the generated SQL for the operation",
            "plan": [String] -- "Postgres's plan for the generated SQL"
        }
    ]

The response for a subscription is a single plan:

.. code-block:: none

    {
        "sql": String -- "the generated SQL for the operation",
        "plan": [String] -- "Postgres's plan for the generated SQL"
    }
