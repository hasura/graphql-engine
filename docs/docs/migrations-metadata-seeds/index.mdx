# Migrations & Metadata Introduction

Hasura needs two pieces of information which work together to describe your Hasura setup

- **Migrations** - Representing the underlying database schema.
- **Metadata** - Describing the exposed Hasura GraphQL API and all other configuration.

---

## Hasura Migrations

**Keep track of your database schema over time.**

Hasura Migrations are a SQL representation of the state of your database schema which can be used to keep track of,
update, roll-back or move your schema using the [Hasura CLI](/hasura-cli/index.mdx).

They are automatically generated in a series of Unix nanosecond timestamped directories consisting of `up.sql` and
`down.sql` files in pure SQL syntax, which describe to Hasura Server both how to create, (`up.sql`) and how to roll back
(`down.sql`) each of your database changes step-by-step.

When these files are committed to version control, your database schema state can be kept in-sync with your codebase.

When used in combination with CI/CD, changes to your database schema can automatically and elegantly be applied to your
app's development, staging or production versions.

Example `migrations` directory created with the Hasura CLI:

```text
ğŸ“‚ migrations
â””â”€ ğŸ“‚ default
   â””â”€ ğŸ“‚ 1654696186008_init
      â””â”€ ğŸ“„ up.sql
   â””â”€ ğŸ“‚ 1654698227514_create_table_public_address
      â”œâ”€ ğŸ“„ down.sql
      â””â”€ ğŸ“„ up.sql
```

## Hasura Metadata

**The configuration of your Hasura Server**

Hasura Metadata is a representation of the configuration of the Hasura Server. From actions to databases and their
tables, to permissions, event triggers and API limits, everything regarding the config of the Hasura Server is
represented in Metadata.

Metadata can also be tracked with version control, allowing your Hasura Metadata to be kept in-sync with your code and
database schema changes.

The state of Hasura Metadata is managed via snapshots of the state of the Hasura Server Metadata configuration. These
snapshots can be applied as a whole, using the [Hasura CLI](/hasura-cli/index.mdx) to the Hasura Server.

Example `metadata` directory created with the Hasura CLI:

```text
ğŸ“‚ metadata
â”œâ”€ ğŸ“‚ databases
â”‚  â”œâ”€ ğŸ“‚ default
â”‚  â”‚  â””â”€ ğŸ“‚ tables
â”‚  â”‚     â”œâ”€ ğŸ“„ public_address.yaml
â”‚  â”‚     â”œâ”€ ğŸ“„ public_author.yaml
â”‚  â”‚     â”œâ”€ ğŸ“„ public_article.yaml
â”‚  â”‚     â””â”€ ğŸ“„ tables.yaml
â”‚  â””â”€â”€ ğŸ“„ databases.yaml
â”œâ”€ ğŸ“„ actions.graphql
â”œâ”€ ğŸ“„ actions.yaml
â”œâ”€ ğŸ“„ allow_list.yaml
â”œâ”€ ğŸ“„ api_limits.yaml
â”œâ”€ ğŸ“„ cron_triggers.yaml
â”œâ”€ ğŸ“„ graphql_schema_introspection.yaml
â”œâ”€ ğŸ“„ inherited_roles.yaml
â”œâ”€ ğŸ“„ network.yaml
â”œâ”€ ğŸ“„ query_collections.yaml
â”œâ”€ ğŸ“„ remote_schemas.yaml
â”œâ”€ ğŸ“„ rest_endpoints.yaml
â””â”€ ğŸ“„ version.yaml
```

### Config versions

Migrations and Metadata follow their own versioning scheme separate to the that of the Hasura Server and CLI. This
documentation is for the latest Hasura Migrations `config v3`, supported from `v2.0.0-alpha.1`. (See
[upgrade guide](/migrations-metadata-seeds/legacy-configs/upgrade-v3.mdx)).

For `config v2`, see [Migrations (config v2)](/migrations-metadata-seeds/legacy-configs/config-v2/index.mdx). For
`config v1`, see [Migrations (config v1)](/migrations-metadata-seeds/legacy-configs/config-v1/index.mdx).
