# <Troubleshooting /> Troubleshooting Hasura GraphQL Engine Errors

## Introduction

This section provides references that can help in troubleshooting errors when developing with Hasura.

## Logs

In order to find out about the origins of an error, it can be helpful to check the logs.

:::info Metrics and distributed tracing in Hasura Cloud

Hasura Cloud includes metrics and distributed tracing which makes troubleshooting faster. For more information, see
[Metrics](/observability/overview.mdx) and [Tracing](/observability/cloud-monitoring/tracing.mdx) in Hasura Cloud.

### Server logs

For errors that come from the Hasura server, server logs will give you more insights. For details on how you can access
these logs, as well as different log types, visit [this page](/deployment/logging.mdx).

### Console logs

Should there be any error coming from the Hasura Console UI, they will show up in the Browser dev tools.

### Remote service logs

Errors can come from a remote service, such as [Remote Schemas](/remote-schemas/overview.mdx),
[Events](/event-triggers/overview.mdx) or [Actions](/actions/overview.mdx). In this case, check the errors of the
respective remote service. For Actions, check out this [debugging page](/actions/debugging.mdx).

It's possible that someone with the same problem has created a GitHub issue on the
[Hasura repo](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/issues). If you don't come across an issue with solution in your
search, feel free to create a [new issue](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/issues/new).

## Hasura blog

- [Postgres documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/index.html).

## Client-side

### SSL certificate errors

SSL certificate errors occur when a web browser can't verify the SSL certificate installed on a site. For SSL errors
such as:

```
ERROR:
{
code: EPROTO,
errno: EPROTO,
message:
request to <graphql-api> failed, reason: write EPROTO <....> alert handshake failure:..<...>: SSL alert number 40
}
```

Follow the steps below to try and resolve the issue:

1. Whitelist the EPROTO error code (in client-side code).
2. Allow the retry logic to be activated.
3. Monitor the system for improvements or changes in the reconciliation process.
