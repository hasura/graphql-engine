# Securing projects

## Introduction

To make sure that your GraphQL endpoint is not publicly accessible, a
randomly generated admin secret key is added by default to your project
at the time of project creation.

## Updating the admin secret

### Step 1: Go to settings

On the project overview, click on the settings icon on the top right of
the relevant project.

### Step 2: Navigate to env vars

On the `Env vars` tab, you will see the `HASURA_GRAPHQL_ADMIN_SECRET`
env var.

## Accessing Hasura

When you launch the console from the Hasura Cloud dashboard, you'll be
authenticated as an admin. If you want to make API calls from outside
the console, you need to pass the admin secret as the <em>x-hasura-admin-secret</em> request header.

:::info Note

The admin secret should be treated like a password i.e. it should be
kept secret and shouldn't be passed from frontend clients. Refer
[this](/graphql/core/auth/authentication/index.mdx) to set up user authentication.
