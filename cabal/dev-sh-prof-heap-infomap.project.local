-- TODO COMING UP: We would like to turn on these flags always. But for now the
--   resulting binary size increase is too large. This will improve in GHC 9.4, but
--   also we may need to wait until further work on compressing IPE info lands.
--   (Likewise we might want to always link with -eventlog)

-- Formerly we had:
-- import: cabal/dev-sh-optimized.project.local
-- ...but cabal 3.10 broke it. See: TODO
-- ...so now we need to copy-paste that configuration here to avoid import chains

-- coverage inhibits performance. NOTE: we can't just put this at the top level
-- to override, since it seems package-specific configuration takes precedence...
