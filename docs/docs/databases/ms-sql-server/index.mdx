# MS SQL Server

## Introduction

Hasura allows connecting to a SQL Server database and build a GraphQL API based on the database schema.

:::tip Supported versions:

1.  Hasura GraphQL Engine `v2.0.0-alpha.2` onwards
2.  SQL Server 2016 and upwards

:::

## Get Started

To try Hasura with SQL Server, you'll need your own new or existing SQL Server database.

Here are 2 ways you can get started with Hasura and SQL Server:

1.  [Hasura Cloud](/databases/ms-sql-server/getting-started/cloud.mdx): You'll need to be able to access your SQL Server
    database from Hasura Cloud.
2.  [Docker](/databases/ms-sql-server/getting-started/docker.mdx): Run Hasura with Docker and then connect your SQL
    Server database to Hasura.

## Supported features

Hasura currently supports queries, subscriptions, mutations, relationships, permissions, and Event Triggers on MS SQL
Server.

## Required permissions

Assuming a `CONNECT` permission already exists, the following permissions are required for Hasura to function completely. Note that missing permissions may cause the corresponding features to work incorrectly:

* To use the Hasura Console to alter your schema, you will need appropriate schema permissions, such as `CREATE TABLE`, `CREATE VIEW`, `CREATE FUNCTION`, and `CREATE PROCEDURE`, depending on what you want to do.
* To perform queries and mutations, Hasura will need permission to `DELETE`, `INSERT`, `SELECT`, and `UPDATE`.
* To call MSSQL stored procedures via Hasura, the `EXECUTE` permission is also required.
