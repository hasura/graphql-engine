# Connecting Hasura to a Google AlloyDB Postgres Database

## Introduction

This guide explains how to connect a new or existing [Google AlloyDB Postgres](https://cloud.google.com/alloydb)
database to a Hasura instance, either on [Hasura Cloud](https://cloud.hasura.io) or via one of our
[self-hosted](/deployment/deployment-guides/index.mdx) solutions. If you're exploring AlloyDB Postgres, check out
their [docs](https://cloud.google.com/alloydb/docs) before continuing below.

:::info Note

If you plan on using Hasura Cloud, which we recommend, follow steps 1 and 2 below. If you're self-hosting a Hasura instance and
already have a project running, skip to [step 3](#create-pg-db-alloy).

:::

## Step 1: Sign up or log in to Hasura Cloud

Navigate to [Hasura Cloud](https://cloud.hasura.io/signup/?pg=docs&plcmt=body&cta=navigate-to-hasura-cloud&tech=default)
and sign up or log in.

## Step 2: Create a Hasura Cloud project {#create-hasura-project-alloy}

On the Hasura Cloud dashboard, create a new project:

<Thumbnail src='/img/cloud-dbs/create-hasura-cloud-project.png' alt='Create Hasura Cloud project' width='1000px' />

After the project is initialized successfully, click on `Launch Console` to open the Hasura Console in your browser.

On the Hasura Console, navigate to the `Data` tab and choose `Connect Existing Database`. Hasura will prompt you for a
Postgres Database URL. We'll create this in the next step and then come back here.

<Thumbnail src='/img/cloud-dbs/alloy/alloy-existing-db-setup.png' alt='Hasura Cloud database setup' width='700px' />

## Step 3: Create an AlloyDB database {#create-pg-db-alloy}

Head [here](https://cloud.google.com/alloydb) to learn more about and to try AlloyDB. If logged in, click
`Go to console`:

<Thumbnail src='/img/cloud-dbs/alloy/alloy-splash.png' alt='AlloyDB splash page' width='1000px' />

You'll be redirected to GCP where you can get started with AlloyDB by clicking `ENABLE`:

<Thumbnail src='/img/cloud-dbs/alloy/alloy-enable.png' alt='AlloyDB enable page' width='1000px' />

To get started, create a cluster by clicking `CREATE CLUSTER`:

<Thumbnail src='/img/cloud-dbs/alloy/alloy-create-cluster.png' alt='AlloyDB create cluster' width='1000px' />

If not already enabled, click, `ENABLE APIS`:

<Thumbnail src='/img/cloud-dbs/alloy/alloy-enable-apis.png' alt='AlloyDB enable APIs' width='1000px' />

Choose your cluster type:

<Thumbnail src='/img/cloud-dbs/alloy/alloy-choose-cluster.png' alt='AlloyDB choose cluster' width='1000px' />

:::info Note

As GCP states, your selection isn't permanent. At the time of writing this document, only two options are available as
the others are currently in development: `Highly available` and `Highly available with read pools`.

:::

Configure your cluster by providing the information required:

<Thumbnail src='/img/cloud-dbs/alloy/alloy-configure-cluster.png' alt='AlloyDB configure cluster' width='1000px' />

Under the Networking tab, you'll be prompted to set up a list of IP addresses for your services. Click
`SET UP CONNECTION`:

<Thumbnail src='/img/cloud-dbs/alloy/alloy-set-up-connection.png' alt='AlloyDB set up connection' width='1000px' />

Either select an IP range or let GCP automatically allocate a range. After making your selection, click `CONTINUE` and
then `CREATE CONNECTION`:

<Thumbnail src='/img/cloud-dbs/alloy/alloy-allocate-ip.png' alt='AlloyDB allocate IP' width='1000px' />

With your cluster configured, you now need to configure your primary instance. Fill in the required information before
clicking `CREATE CLUSTER`:

<Thumbnail src='/img/cloud-dbs/alloy/alloy-cluster-created.png' alt='AlloyDB cluster created' width='1000px' />

## Step 4: Create an AlloyDB auth proxy {#create-auth-proxy}

AlloyDB requires an auth proxy to make authorized, encrypted connections to an instance. You can follow GCP's
instructions, found [here](https://cloud.google.com/alloydb/docs/auth-proxy/connect), to create your auth proxy and
generate a connection string to use with Hasura. However, we'll also continue below with a Hasura-specific
implementation.

### Create a GCE instance {#create-gce-instance}

Create a Compute Engine VM that can connect to AlloyDB instances using private services access.

Navigate to the **VM Instances page** and click `CREATE INSTANCE`:

<Thumbnail src='/img/cloud-dbs/alloy/alloy-vm-create-instance.png' alt='AlloyDB VM create instance' width='1000px' />

Provide a name for this instance and set the following properties:

- Access scopes

  Set to Allow full access to all Cloud APIs.

- Network interfaces

  Set to the VPC network configured for private services access to your AlloyDB instance.

  :::tip Tip

  For the best performance, select the GCE region as the same or closest to whichever region hosts your Hasura instance.

  :::

Click `CREATE`.

### Get the IP address of the AlloyDB instance

**From the cluster listing page for your AlloyDB instance**, get the private IP address of the instance. You'll use this
in the next step to run the auth proxy and connect it to the AlloyDB instance:

<Thumbnail src='/img/cloud-dbs/alloy/alloy-get-db-ip.png' alt='AlloyDB get IP of db' width='1000px' />

**From your GCE-created VM instance**,
[download the auth proxy](https://cloud.google.com/alloydb/docs/auth-proxy/connect) and, per GCP's instructions, make
the file executable.

You can start the auth proxy by running this command:

```bash
./alloydb-auth-proxy "projects/<project-id>/locations/<region>/clusters/<alloydb-cluster-id>/instances/<alloydb-instance-id>" --address "0.0.0.0"
```

:::info Note

This starts the auth proxy client and exposes it to the public. **Do note that this setup is an ephemeral one. You
should run the auth proxy in a permanent mode (for example, via
[docker detached mode](https://cloud.google.com/alloydb/docs/auth-proxy/connect#docker-container)).**

Additionally, you may have to specify a different version of the auth proxy, such as `alloydb-auth-proxy.linux.amd64`.

:::

## Step 5: Add a firewall rule

With our auth proxy now running, you'll need to create a firewall rule that allows a connection from your Hasura
instance. If using Hasura Cloud, from your project's dashboard, copy the Hasura Cloud IP address:

<Thumbnail src='/img/cloud-dbs/alloy/alloy-hasura-ip.png' alt='AlloyDB get IP of Hasura Cloud project' width='1000px' />

:::info Note

If you're using a self-hosted solution, you'll need to determine the IP address manually depending on your hosting
service.

:::

Within the **VPC Firewall settings**, add a new rule by clicking, `CREATE FIREWALL RULE`:

<Thumbnail src='/img/cloud-dbs/alloy/alloy-create-firewall.png' alt='AlloyDB create firewall rule' width='1000px' />

Permit connections to port `5432` and specify the IP address of your Hasura instance in the IPv4 range and click
`CREATE`:

<Thumbnail src='/img/cloud-dbs/alloy/alloy-firewall-settings.png' alt='AlloyDB firewall rule settings' width='1000px' />

## Step 6: Construct the database connection URL and connect the database {#construct-db-url-alloy}

The structure of the database connection URL looks as follows:

```bash
postgresql://<database-user>:<postgres-password>@<ip-address-of-gce-instance>:5432/<database-name>
```

- The `database-user` and `database-name` are both `postgres` by default.
- The `postgres-password` is the password you entered when creating the AlloyDB cluster in
  [step 3](#create-pg-db-alloy).
- The `ip-address-of-gce-instance` is from [step 4](#create-gce-instance) when you created a GCE VM instance.

Back on the Hasura Console, enter the database URL:

<Thumbnail src='/img/cloud-dbs/alloy/alloy-connect-db.png' alt='AlloyDB connect db' width='1000px' />

Then click `Connect Database`.

:::info Note

For security reasons, it is recommended to set database URLs as [env vars](/projects/env-vars.mdx) and using the env
vars to connect to the databases in place of the raw database URLs.

:::

Voilà. You are ready to start developing.

## Next steps

- You can check out our [30-Minute Hasura Basics Course](https://hasura.io/learn/graphql/hasura/introduction/) and other
  [GraphQL & Hasura Courses](https://hasura.io/learn/) for a more detailed introduction to Hasura.

- If using Hasura Cloud, you can also click the gear icon to manage your Hasura Cloud project. (e.g. add
  [collaborators](/projects/collaborators.mdx), [env vars](/projects/env-vars.mdx) or
  [custom domains](/projects/domains.mdx)).
