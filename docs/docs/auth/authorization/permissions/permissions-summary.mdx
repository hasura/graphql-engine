# Permissions Summary

To see a summary of all the permissions you've added to your roles, go to the Permissions Summary section which can
be found by clicking the button on a database page in the Console

<Thumbnail src='/img/auth/authorization_permissions-summary-link_2-16-1.png' alt='Create a view' />

Here you can see a summary of all the permissions you've added per database operation, table and role. Use the
drop-down in the top left in order to switch database operations.

## Copy a role

You can also use this screen in Console in order to copy a role and its permissions to another role or a new role
which greatly speeds up the permissions creation process if you are using the Console.

## Delete a role

You can also delete a role by clicking on the bin icon next to its name. Note that if the role is part of an
[inherited role](/auth/authorization/inherited-roles.mdx), you will need to delete or edit that first in order to delete
the role.
