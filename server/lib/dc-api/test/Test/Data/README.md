# Chinook Dataset
This dataset is sourced from https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database/

More specifically, the `Chinook.xml.gz` file is a GZipped version of https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lerocha/chinook-database/ce27c48d9f375f81b7b68bacdfddf3c4458acc49/ChinookDatabase/DataSources/_Xml/ChinookData.xml

The `schema-tables.json` is manually derived from the schema of the data as can be seen from the `CREATE TABLE` etc DML statements in the various per-database-vendor SQL scripts that can be found in `/ChinookDatabase/DataSources` in that repo.
