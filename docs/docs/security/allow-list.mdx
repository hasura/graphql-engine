# Allow List of Operations

## Introduction

The **Allow List** is a list of safe operations (_GraphQL queries, mutations or subscriptions_) that is stored by the
GraphQL Engine in its Metadata. When enabled, it can be used to restrict the GraphQL Engine so that it executes **only**
those operations that are present in the list.

## Enable Allow List

Allow-list validation can be enabled by setting the `HASURA_GRAPHQL_ENABLE_ALLOWLIST` environment variable to `true` or
running the GraphQL Engine with the `--enable-allowlist` flag (_default value is_ `false`). See
[reference docs](/deployment/graphql-engine-flags/reference.mdx#command-flags).

:::info Note

Allow-list validation will not be enforced for the `admin` role.

## Open Allow List manager

Head to the `API` tab and find the `Allow List` section in the Console.

## Adding or removing an operation in Allow List

<Tabs groupId="user-preference" className="api-tabs">
<TabItem value="console" label="Console">

Head to the `API` tab and find the `Allow List` section in the Console.

- **Write operation**: You can add an individual operation, like the one below, manually to the Allow List. These
  operations require unique names. This unique name is used an identifier for the query in the collection, it is not
  related to the operation name of the query.

```graphql
query ($id: Int!) {
  user_by_pk(id: $id) {
    __typename
    id
    name
    company
  }
}
```

After writing your query or selecting a query from quick add dropdown menu, click `Add Operation`.

- **Upload File**: Alternatively, you can upload files, like this
  [sample file](https://gist.github.com/dsandip/8b1b4aa87708289d4c9f8fd9621eb025), to add multiple operations to the
  Allow List. Each operation in the file will need a unique name. Once you've selected your file, click `Add Operation`.

Head to the `/metadata/databases/query_collections.yaml` file and add the database configuration as below:

```yaml {6-7}
- name: allowed-queries
  definition:
    queries:
      - name: bv
        query: |-
          query MyQuery {
            test {
              age
              id
            }
          }
      - name: operation_name
        query: |-
          query MyQuery {
            test {
              age
              id
            }
          }
```

Apply the Metadata by running:

```bash
hasura metadata apply
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="api" label="API">

Queries can be stored in collections and a collection can be added to or removed from the Allow List. See
[Collections & Allow List APIs](/api-reference/metadata-api/query-collections.mdx) for API reference.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info Note

- Allow List queries are validated against the schema. Adding an invalid query will result in an inconsistent Metadata
  error.

- `__typename` introspection fields will be ignored when adding operations and comparing them to the Allow List.

- Any introspection queries that your client apps require must be explicitly added to the Allow List to allow running
  them.

- The order of fields in a query will be **strictly** compared. E.g. assuming the query in the first example above is
  part of the Allow List, the following query will be **rejected**:

```graphql
query ($id: Int!) {
  user_by_pk(id: $id) {
    __typename
    name
    id
    company
  }
}
```

- The Allow List is stored in Hasura's Metadata. To version control the state of the list, you are required to export
  the Metadata. See [Managing Hasura Metadata](/migrations-metadata-seeds/manage-metadata.mdx) for more details.

- You can modify the Allow List without actually enabling it on your instance.

:::

## Role-based Allow List

<ProductBadge standard pro ee self />

A role-based Allow List is useful when you would like a query collection(s) to be accessible to only certain roles.

:::info Note

Server support for Role-based Allow Lists in Cloud/Enterprise products is available from version `v2.3` and Console
support is available from version `v2.13`. In OSS, role-based entries are ignored.

On older versions (which do not support role-based Allow Lists), any role-based Allow List Metadata entry will be
treated as global. Hence, caution is advised when using role-based Allow List Metadata with older versions.

<Tabs groupId="user-preference" className="api-tabs">
<TabItem value="console" label="Console">

Head to the `API` tab and find the `Allow List` section on the Console. On the left side bar, you can see a list of
query collections. After selecting a query collection, you can enable the roles which should have access to any query
collection via the `Permissions` tab.

<Thumbnail src="/img/api-explorer/role-based-allow-list.png" alt="Role based allow list" />

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

Head to the `/metadata/databases/allow_list.yaml` file and add the database configuration as below:

```yaml {17-19}
query_collections:
  - name: allowed-queries
    definition:
      queries: []
  - name: editor_allowed_queries
    definition:
      queries: []
  - name: user_allowed_queries
    definition:
      queries: []
allowlist:
  - collection: allowed-queries
    scope:
      global: true
  - collection: editor_allowed_queries
    scope:
      global: false
      roles:
        - editor
  - collection: user_allowed_queries
    scope:
      global: false
      roles:
        - user
```

Apply the Metadata by running:

```bash
hasura metadata apply
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="api" label="API">

You can update the roles in the Allow List by using the
[update_scope_of_collection_in_allowlist](/api-reference/metadata-api/query-collections.mdx#metadata-update-scope-of-collection-in-allowlist)
Metadata API.

## Quick-create allowed operations

<ProductBadge free standard pro ee />

### Hasura Cloud

This feature lets you add to the Allow List with one click from the record of past operations. (With Hasura GraphQL
Engine CE, Allow Lists must be managed manually).

## Recommended usage

The following are the recommended best practices for enabling/disabling Allow-List-based validation:

- **In development instances**: During development or in dev instances, disable the Allow List (_default setting_) to
  enable complete access to the GraphQL schema. Add/remove operations in the Allow List and then export the Metadata for
  version-control (_so you can apply it to other instances_).
- **In CI/CD instances**: Enable the Allow List for testing.
- **In production instances**: Enabling the Allow List is highly recommended when running the GraphQL Engine in
  production.
