Introduction
------------

Hasura allows connecting to a SQL Server database and build a GraphQL API based on the database schema.

.. admonition:: Supported versions:

  1. Hasura GraphQL engine ``v2.0.0-alpha.2`` onwards
  2. SQL Server 2016 and upwards

Get Started
-----------

To try Hasura with SQL Server, you'll need your own new or existing SQL Server database.

Here are 2 ways you can get started with Hasura and SQL Server:

1. :ref:`Hasura Cloud <database_ms_sql_server_cloud>`: You'll need to be able to access your SQL Server database from Hasura Cloud.
2. :ref:`Docker <database_ms_sql_server_docker>`: Run Hasura with Docker and then connect your SQL Server database to Hasura.

Supported features
------------------

Hasura currently supports queries, subscriptions, mutations, relationships and permissions on MS SQL Server.

Next up on our roadmap for Hasura + SQL Server:

- Support for stored procedures & functions (`#7073 <https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/issues/7073>`__)
- Event triggers: Trigger HTTP webhooks with atomic capture and atleast once guarantee whenever data changes inside the database (`#7075 <https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/issues/7075>`__)
- Remote Joins: Join models in SQL Server to models from other API services (GraphQL or REST) (`#7076 <https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/issues/7076>`__)
