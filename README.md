# Hasura GraphQL Engine

The Hasura engine is an open source project which supercharges the building of modern applications by providing access 
to data via a single, composable, secure API endpoint.

The Hasura V3 engine code, which powers Hasura DDN, is in the `V3` folder of this repo. You can find more detailed 
information about the Hasura DDN Graphql Engine in this [README](/v3/README.md).

The Hasura DDN architecture includes Data Connectors to connect to data sources. All Hasura connectors are also 
available completely open source. Check out the [Connector Hub](https://hasura.io/connectors/) which lists all 
available connectors.

## Cloning repository

This repository is a large and active mono-repo containing many parts of the Hasura ecosystem and a long git 
history, that can make the first time cloning of the repository slow and consume a lot of disk space. We recommend 
following if you are facing cloning issues.

### Shallow clone

This will only clone the latest commit and ignore all historical commits. 

```
git clone https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine.git --depth 1
```

### Git checkout with only Hasura V3 engine code
```
git clone --no-checkout https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine.git --depth 1
cd graphql-engine
git sparse-checkout init --cone
git sparse-checkout set v3
git checkout @
```
This checkouts the top level files and only the `v3` folder which contains the Hasura V3 Engine code.
