## Different log-types {#log-types}

The Hasura GraphQL engine has different kind of log-types depending on
the sub-system or the layer. A log-type is simply the `type` field in a
log line, which indicates which sub-system the log comes from.

For example, the HTTP webserver logs incoming requests as an access log
and is called `http-log`. Similarly logs from the websocket layer are
called `websocket-log`, logs from the event trigger system are called
`event-trigger` etc.

You can configure the GraphQL engine to enable/disable certain log-types
using the the `--enabled-log-types` flag or the
`HASURA_GRAPHQL_ENABLED_LOG_TYPES` env var. See [GraphQL Engine server config reference](/graphql/core/deployment/graphql-engine-flags/reference.mdx)

Default enabled log-types are:
`startup, http-log, webhook-log, websocket-log`

All the log-types that can be enabled/disabled are:

| Log type        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Log Level          |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| `startup`       | Information that is logged during startup                                                                                                                                                                                         | `info`             |
| `query-log`     | Logs: the entire GraphQL query with variables, generated SQL statements (only for database queries, not for mutations/subscriptions or remote schema and action queries), the operation name (if provided in the GraphQL request) | `info`             |
| `http-log`      | Http access and error logs at the webserver layer (handling GraphQL and metadata requests)                                                                                                                                        | `info` and `error` |
| `websocket-log` | Websocket events and error logs at the websocket server layer (handling GraphQL requests)                                                                                                                                         | `info` and `error` |
| `webhook-log`   | Logs responses and errors from the authorization webhook (if setup)                                                                                                                                                               | `info` and `error` |

Configurable log-types

Apart from the above, there are other internal log-types which cannot be
configured:

| Log type             | Description                                                                                         | Log Level          |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| `pg-client`          | Logs from the postgres client library                                                               | `warn`             |
| `metadata`           | Logs inconsistent metadata items                                                                    | `warn`             |
| `jwk-refresh-log`    | Logs information and errors about periodic refreshing of JWK                                        | `info` and `error` |
| `telemetry-log`      | Logs error (if any) while sending out telemetry data                                                | `info`             |
| `event-trigger`      | Logs HTTP responses from the webhook, HTTP exceptions and internal errors                           | `info` and `error` |
| `ws-server`          | Debug logs from the websocket server, mostly used internally for debugging                          | `debug`            |
| `schema-sync-thread` | Logs internal events, when it detects schema has changed on Postgres and when it reloads the schema | `info` and `error` |

Internal log-types

## Logging levels

You can set the desired logging level on the server using the
`log-level` flag or the `HASURA_GRAPHQL_LOG_LEVEL` env var. See
[GraphQL Engine server config reference](/graphql/core/deployment/graphql-engine-flags/reference.mdx).

The default log-level is `info`.

Setting a log-level will print all logs of priority greater than the set
level. The log-level hierarchy is: `debug > info > warn > error`

For example, setting `--log-level=warn`, will enable all warn and error
level logs only. So even if you have enabled `query-log` it won't be
printed as the level of `query-log` is `info`.

See [log-types](#log-types) for more details on log-level of each
log-type.

## Log structure and metrics

All requests are identified by a request id. If the client sends a
`x-request-id` header then that is used, otherwise a request id is
generated for each request. This is also sent back to the client as a
response header (`x-request-id`). This is useful to correlate logs from
the server and the client.

### **query-log** structure

On enabling verbose logging, i.e. enabling `query-log`, GraphQL engine
will log the full GraphQL query object on each request.

It will also log the generated SQL for GraphQL queries (but not
mutations and subscriptions).

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2019-06-03T13:25:10.915+0530",
  "level": "info",
  "type": "query-log",
  "detail": {
    "kind": "database",
    "request_id": "840f952d-c489-4d21-a87a-cc23ad17926a",
    "query": {
      "variables": {
        "limit": 10
      },
      "operationName": "getProfile",
      "query": "query getProfile($limit: Int!) {\n  profile(limit: $limit, where: {username: {_like: \"%a%\"}}) {\n    username\n  }\n  myusername: profile (where: {username: {_eq: \"foobar\"}}) {\n    username\n  }\n}\n"
    },
    "generated_sql": {
      "profile": {
        "prepared_arguments": ["{\"x-hasura-role\":\"admin\"}", "%a%"],
        "query": "SELECT  coalesce(json_agg(\"root\" ), '[]' ) AS \"root\" FROM  (SELECT  row_to_json((SELECT  \"_1_e\"  FROM  (SELECT  \"_0_root.base\".\"username\" AS \"username\"       ) AS \"_1_e\"      ) ) AS \"root\" FROM  (SELECT  *  FROM \"public\".\"profile\"  WHERE ((\"public\".\"profile\".\"username\") LIKE ($2))     ) AS \"_0_root.base\"     LIMIT 10 ) AS \"_2_root\"      "
      },
      "myusername": {
        "prepared_arguments": ["{\"x-hasura-role\":\"admin\"}", "foobar"],
        "query": "SELECT  coalesce(json_agg(\"root\" ), '[]' ) AS \"root\" FROM  (SELECT  row_to_json((SELECT  \"_1_e\"  FROM  (SELECT  \"_0_root.base\".\"username\" AS \"username\"       ) AS \"_1_e\"      ) ) AS \"root\" FROM  (SELECT  *  FROM \"public\".\"profile\"  WHERE ((\"public\".\"profile\".\"username\") = ($2))     ) AS \"_0_root.base\"      ) AS \"_2_root\"      "
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The `type` of in the log with be `query-log`. All the details are nested
under the `detail` key.

This log contains 3 important fields:

-   `kind`: indicates the type or kind of operation. `kind` can be
    `database`, `action`, `remote-schema`, `cached` or `introspection`
-   `request_id`: A unique ID for each request. If the client sends a
    `x-request-id` header then that is respected, otherwise a UUID is
    generated for each request. This is useful to correlate between
    `http-log` and `query-log`.
-   `query`: Contains the full GraphQL request including the variables
    and operation name.
-   `generated_sql`: this contains the generated SQL for GraphQL
    queries. For mutations and subscriptions this field will be `null`.

### **http-log** structure

This is how the HTTP access logs look like:

-   On success response:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2019-05-30T23:40:24.654+0530",
  "level": "info",
  "type": "http-log",
  "detail": {
    "request_id": "072b3617-6653-4fd5-b5ee-580e9d098c3d",
    "operation": {
      "query_execution_time": 0.009240042,
      "user_vars": {
        "x-hasura-role": "user"
      },
      "error": null,
      "request_id": "072b3617-6653-4fd5-b5ee-580e9d098c3d",
      "parameterized_query_hash": "7116865cef017c3b09e5c9271b0e182a6dcf4c01",
      "response_size": 105,
      "query": null
    },
    "http_info": {
      "status": 200,
      "http_version": "HTTP/1.1",
      "url": "/v1/graphql",
      "ip": "127.0.0.1",
      "method": "POST"
    }
  }
}
```

-   On error response:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2019-05-29T15:22:37.834+0530",
  "level": "error",
  "type": "http-log",
  "detail": {
    "operation": {
      "query_execution_time": 0.000656144,
      "user_vars": {
        "x-hasura-role": "user",
        "x-hasura-user-id": "1"
      },
      "error": {
        "path": "$.selectionSet.profile.selectionSet.usernamex",
        "error": "field \"usernamex\" not found in type: 'profile'",
        "code": "validation-failed"
      },
      "request_id": "072b3617-6653-4fd5-b5ee-580e9d098c3d",
      "response_size": 142,
      "query": {
        "variables": {
          "limit": 10
        },
        "operationName": "getProfile",
        "query": "query getProfile($limit: Int!) { profile(limit: $limit, where:{username: {_like: \"%a%\"}}) { usernamex} }"
      }
    },
    "http_info": {
      "status": 200,
      "http_version": "HTTP/1.1",
      "url": "/v1/graphql",
      "ip": "127.0.0.1",
      "method": "POST"
    }
}
```

The `type` in the log will be `http-log` for HTTP access/error log. This
log contains basic information about the HTTP request and the GraphQL
operation.

It has two important "keys" under the `detail` section - `operation` and
`http_info`.

`http_info` lists various information regarding the HTTP request, e.g.
IP address, URL path, HTTP status code etc.

`operation` lists various information regarding the GraphQL
query/operation.

-   `query_execution_time`: the time taken to parse the GraphQL query
    (from JSON request), compile it to SQL with permissions and user
    session variables, and then executing it and fetching the results
    back from Postgres. The unit is in seconds.
-   `user_vars`: contains the user session variables. Or the
    `x-hasura-*` session variables inferred from the authorization mode.
-   `request_id`: A unique ID for each request. If the client sends a
    `x-request-id` header then that is respected, otherwise a UUID is
    generated for each request.
-   `response_size`: Size of the response in bytes.
-   `error`: *optional*. Will contain the error object when there is an
    error, otherwise this will be `null`. This key can be used to detect
    if there is an error in the request. The status code for error
    requests will be `200` on the `v1/graphql` endpoint.
-   `query`: *optional*. This will contain the GraphQL query object only
    when there is an error. On successful response this will be `null`.
-   `parametrized_query_hash` (\*): Hash of the incoming GraphQL query
    after resolving variables with all the leaf nodes (i.e. scalar
    values) discarded. This value will only be logged when the request
    is successful. For example, all the queries mentioned in the below
    snippet will compute the same parametrized query hash.

```graphql
# sample query
query {
  authors (where: {id: {_eq: 2}}) {
    id
    name
  }
}

# query with a different leaf value to that of the sample query
query {
  authors (where: {id: {_eq: 203943}}) {
    id
    name
  }
}

# query with use of a variable, the value of
# the variable `id` can be anything
query {
  authors (where: {id: {_eq: $id}}) {
    id
    name
  }
}

# query with use of a boolean expression variable,
# the value when the `whereBoolExp` is in the form of
#
#  {
#     "id": {
#       "_eq": <id>
#     }
#  }

query {
  authors (where: $whereBoolExp) {
    id
    name
  }
}
```

### **websocket-log** structure

This is how the Websocket logs look like:

-   On successful operation start:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2019-06-10T10:52:54.247+0530",
  "level": "info",
  "type": "websocket-log",
  "detail": {

        "query": {
          "variables": {},

## Monitoring frameworks

You can integrate the logs emitted by Hasura GraphQL with external
monitoring tools for better visibility as per your convenience.

For some examples, see [Guides: Integrating with monitoring frameworks](/graphql/core/guides/monitoring.mdx)
