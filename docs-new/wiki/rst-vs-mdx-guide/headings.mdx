# Headings & Id's

Good news, these are already handled by script and transformed correctly from `h1 (#) => h6 (######)`.

But, script missed the id's for each. This page is to help fix that.

## Heading Ids {#heading-ids}

Docusaurus will by default generate an id for each heading to be able to link to individual sections.

There is one caveat though. The generated id's are nothing but the `kebab-cased-heading-text-itself`.

Ex:

```markdown
## Heading H2 Example

<!-- will have a generated id as below -->
heading-h2-example
```

To link to this section, we can append the id as a #hash-param to url.

```markdown
[Link to Sub Section](/path/to/sub/section.mdx#heading-h2-example)`.

<!-- or just the hash-param if its in the same document -->

[Link to sub section in same document](#heading-ids)
```


This works as long as there is no change in the respective section heading. Updating the heading would require to scan through all the links that points to this section and update every time.

So, to avoid this manual effort and making the links independeent we will add the id ourself and use it instead.

In the current docs we already added id's to many sub-sections and used them for direct linking instead.

Unfortunately, script missed all the ids :(

## Handling Custom Ids

While migrating a file, make sure to copy the ids for respective headings and add them as `{#kebab-cased-id}`


<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="sphinx" label="Sphinx - RST" default>

```rest {1-4}
.. _create_hasura_project_aws_rds_aurora:

Step 1: Create a Hasura Cloud project
-------------------------------------

On the Hasura Cloud dashboard, create a new project:
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="docusaurus" label="Docusaurus - MDX">

```markdown {1}
## Step 1: Create a Hasura Cloud project {#create-hasura-project-aws-rds-aurora}

On the Hasura Cloud dashboard, create a new project:
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

If there is no `id` set in RST file, Please feel free to skip it (they can be generated when required using the cli command [write-heading-ids](https://docusaurus.io/docs/cli#docusaurus-write-heading-ids-sitedir) - Please DO NOT RUN this during migration).

Can also can skip for `h1 (#)` as the top level heading is beginining of file the direct link without #hash-param would work fine and docusaurus is not attaching id for h1, eitherways its not a blocker.


:::caution Please do not add id in frontmatter

Docusaurus by default uses [file path (including folders) without the extension as the id](https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/plugins/@docusaurus/plugin-content-docs#id) and the same will be slug.

If an `id` is added in frontmatter the slug will by default be the id thus breaking the existing URL structure.

This will result in setting up bunch of redirects and will have a impact on SEO and indexed page rankings.

So, Please ignore the id in frontmatter, Let's leave this to docusaurus default behaviour which is great.

In case, if you are not sure of what to do in a different situation. Please let us know, we will help figure out
