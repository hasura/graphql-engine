Hasura CLI: hasura secret
-------------------------

Add, delete and manage secrets on a Hasura cluster. Sometimes you want to use some secret key or a token such as an API key or a client secret. It is not always a good idea to push these secret keys to a git repository or write them explicitly in your code. Using Hasura you can have your secrets safe in the cluster, and access them whenever you want.
