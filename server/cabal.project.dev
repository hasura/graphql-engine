-- A project configuration for general-purpose development: this builds documentation for
-- dependencies and disables optimizations for graphql-engine to improve compilation times.
--
-- To enable this, you can do:
--   $ ln -s cabal.project.dev cabal.project.local
-- Or, if you want to customize the configuration:
--   $ cp cabal.project.dev cabal.project.local

  -- NOTE: this seems to work so long as there is no 'ghc-options: -O2' in the cabal file,
  -- but new-build will report 'Build profile: -O1' for some reason.
