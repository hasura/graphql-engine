# Build a Data Access Layer

## Overview

This guide, and the others contained in this directory, are intended to be a step-by-step resource to build an
application using Hasura. If you arrived here from the Hasura Cloud Console, you'll have already created a project and
are ready to follow the steps below. If you're here from elsewhere, you can create a
[Hasura Cloud project](https://cloud.hasura.io?skip_onboarding=true) for free and get started right away.

### What we're building

<Thumbnail src="/img/use-case-overview/data-api.svg" alt="Hasura Data API overview" width="600px" />

The application we will be building is a fintech application that allows for a single read-only access layer to three
different databases: one for a banking website, another for a stock and bond trading data, and a real estate database.
The concepts and techniques we will be using apply to any application seeking to build a single data access layer for
their existing databases.

If you've ever been tasked with maintaining numerous sets of data, you know how difficult it can be to keep track of all
the different endpoints, schemas, and access control. With Hasura, you can build a single data access layer that makes
your and your developers' lives easier and allows you to focus on building new features instead of maintaining existing
ones. With all your organization's data accessible through a single GraphQL endpoint, you can monitor and secure your
data with ease, all from a single place.

In the example below, we will be building a data access layer for an existing fintech organization that has three
disparate sources. We will be using Hasura's GraphQL Engine to build a single data access layer that will allow our
teams to access all three sets of data through a single GraphQL endpoint.

By the end of this guide, you will have a fully-functional data access layer that will allow you to build a single
application that can access, join, and secure multiple databases.

## Fully-functional data layer

Steps 1 through 4 will cover everything needed to create a fully-functional data access layer for your existing APIs.

### Step 1. Connect the data sources

In the modern era of building applications, it's not uncommon to have multiple, disparate databases. Additionally, these
data sources may be owned by different teams within the organization. Suppose our banking organization has three
different data sources that need to be accessible to different teams.

To save you time, we've generated three **read-only** databases for you to use in this guide:

| Database    | Description                                                      | Connection String                                                                            |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Banking     | A database containing banking information of the account holders | `postgresql://read_only:kd4555jkfjfkdj39f8f8d9d@35.236.11.122:5432/growth-docs-data-layer-1` |
| Stocks      | A database containing historic, proprietary market information   | `postgresql://read_only:kd4555jkfjfkdj39f8f8d9d@35.236.11.122:5432/growth-docs-data-layer-2` |
| Real Estate | A database containing real estate information                    | `postgresql://read_only:kd4555jkfjfkdj39f8f8d9d@35.236.11.122:5432/growth-docs-data-layer-3` |

:::info Only available from Hasura Cloud

These databases are only accessible from Hasura Cloud.

:::

To connect to these, head to the `Data` tab of your **Hasura Console** — the UI that allows you to interact with your
Hasura instance. Connecting an existing database to Hasura is as easy as pasting in a connection string. Let's name the
first database `Banking` and paste in the connection string from the table above:

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/resources/use-case/access-layer/add-banking.png"
  alt="Adding the banking database to Hasura"
  width="1000px"
/>

Repeat this process for our other two sources.

:::info Securing connection strings

With Hasura, you can use environment variables to secure your connection strings. This is especially useful when
connecting to databases that are not owned by your organization or when moving between environments. To learn more,
check out our [documentation](/deployment/graphql-engine-flags/index.mdx).

:::

We'll need to tell Hasura which tables to track. To do this, we simply need to click the `Track All` button for the
tables present on **each** database. In the example below, you can see we're on the `Banking` database's public schema
inside the `Data` tab:

<Thumbnail src="/img/resources/use-case/access-layer/track-tables.png" alt="Tracking tables in Hasura" width="1000px" />

Hasura can track relationships between tables in your database and expose them as GraphQL fields. To do this, similar to
what we just did, click the `Track All` button for the relationships present on **each** database:

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/resources/use-case/access-layer/track-relationships.png"
  alt="Tracking relationships in Hasura"
  width="1000px"
/>

At this point, we've connected our three databases to Hasura and can now access them through a single GraphQL endpoint.

### Step 2. Customize your schema

If we head over to the `API` tab of our the Console and take a look at the root-level fields of our API, we can see that
we have a lot:

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/resources/use-case/access-layer/before-namespace.png"
  alt="Root-level fields of our API"
  width="1000px"
/>

These databases are relatively simple and only contain a few tables each, so you can imagine how much more overwhelming
it would be if you had your own, production-grade set of data sources. This can make it difficult for your teams to
understand which fields are available and how they can be used.

Not to worry. Hasura can help us simplify this by allowing us to customize the root-level fields of our sources. This
means that we can add a namespace to each database, keeping each set of fields organized.

To do this, we first need to set an environment variable for our project. In Hasura Cloud, your environment variables
are controlled via the project's settings. You can reach these by clicking on the name of your project in the top-right
corner of the Console.

Then, click on the `Env vars` in the project's sidebar and `+ New Env Var` before entering
`HASURA_GRAPHQL_EXPERIMENTAL_FEATURES` and setting its value to `naming_convention`:

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/resources/use-case/access-layer/add-env-var.png"
  alt="Adding an environment variable to Hasura"
  width="1000px"
/>

Finally, head back to the `Data` tab of the Console and choose `Data Manager` in the side bar. Click `Edit` for our
`Banking` source:

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/resources/use-case/access-layer/edit-banking-source.png"
  alt="Editing the banking source"
  width="1000px"
/>

Then, head down to the `GraphQL Customizations` section. If you expand this, you'll be able to add a
`Root Field Namespace` to each of the fields. After adding `banking` to the first field, click `Update Connection`:

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/resources/use-case/access-layer/add-namespace.png"
  alt="Adding a namespace to the banking source"
  width="1000px"
/>

Repeat this process for the other two APIs, adding `real_estate` and `stocks` as the namespace for each. Once complete,
head back to your `API` tab and take a look at the root-level fields of your API. You should now see that each field has
been consolidated into a single namespace:

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/resources/use-case/access-layer/api-after-namespace.png"
  alt="Consolidated fields in the API tab after adding namespaces"
  width="1000px"
/>

:::info Schema customization

Hasura allows you to customize your schema even further! You can add custom fields, change the names of fields, and even
add custom types.

:::

### Step 3. Join the data sources and query data

It's great that we have an easy-to-navigate, unified API, but it'd be nice if we could query across the three data
sources. For example, we might want to query for a user's recent transactions and also get real estate information about
their home.

Hasura allows you to create remote relationships between tables in your database and tables in other databases. We can
create a relationship between the user's account data and the home's historic data by creating a relationship between
these two tables. First, head over to the `Data` tab, choose the `Banking` database, and click on the `customers` table.
Then, choose the `Relationships` tab and click on `+ Add Relationship`:

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/resources/use-case/access-layer/add-remote-relationship.png"
  alt="Adding a remote relationship between the banking and real estate databases"
  width="1000px"
/>

We'll call the relationship `home` and reference the `Real Estate / public / properties` table. Then, within the
details, we'll leave the type of relationship as an `object relationship` and configure our source column to be
`user_address` while referencing `street_address` from the `properties` table before clicking `Create Relationship`. In
all, it should look like this:

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/resources/use-case/access-layer/remote-relationship-details.png"
  alt="Details of the remote relationship between the banking and real estate databases"
  width="1000px"
/>

Let's head back to our `API` tab and query across these two tables! If you enter the query below, you should see that
the first user has a home with returned values while the second user's home is not in the system.

```graphql
query HomeInfo {
  banking {
    customers {
      id
      last_name
      home {
        year_built
        last_sold
        price
      }
    }
  }
}
```

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/resources/use-case/access-layer/home-info-query.png"
  alt="Querying across data sources"
  width="1000px"
/>

:::info Remote relationships of all kinds

With remote relationships, you can join tables across different databases. However, Hasura also has powerful joins
capabilities for GraphQL APIs - called [Remote Schemas](/remote-schemas/overview.mdx) - and REST APIs - called
[Actions](/actions/overview.mdx).

:::

### Step 4. Add authorization to the data sources

With our current setup, anyone can query all the information in these sources. This is fine for some use cases, but we
might want to add authorization to our API. For example, we might want to restrict access to the `users` table of our
`banking` source - and any related data - so that only the user who owns the account can query their own information. We
can do this by adding **permissions** to our sources.

To begin, head to the `Data` tab and select the `customers` table of the `Banking` database. Then, click on the
`Permissions` tab. We'll enter `user` as the role and then click on the ❌ in the `select` column:

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/resources/use-case/access-layer/add-user-role.png"
  alt="Adding a user role to the banking source"
  width="1000px"
/>

We'll add a custom check that we can either create using the GUI's dropdowns, or by pasting this into the `Custom check`
editor:

```json
{ "id": { "_eq": "X-Hasura-User-Id" } }
```

Then, we'll click `Toggle All` so a user can access all columns. Finally, we'll click `Save Permissions`:

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/resources/use-case/access-layer/user-permission-settings.png"
  alt="Setting permissions for the user role"
  width="1000px"
/>

Head back to the `API` tab where we're going to add a couple of new headers. First, we'll add `x-hasura-user-id` and set
its value to `1`. Then, we'll add a second header called `x-hasura-role` which is set to `user`:

<Thumbnail src="/img/resources/use-case/access-layer/headers.png" alt="Adding headers to the API" width="1000px" />

Hopefully you noticed something change. The `Banking` namespace is now the only one that is visible in the GraphiQL
Explorer and, within that, the `customers` table is the only one that is visible. This is because we've added the
`x-hasura-role` header. By including this header, the GraphiQL Explorer reflects the schema available to a user with the
role of `user`.

If we run this query, we'll get data from the `customers` table in the `banking` namespace for the user with the ID of
`1`:

```graphql
query CustomerInfo {
  banking {
    customers {
      id
      first_name
      last_name
      account_id
    }
  }
}
```

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/resources/use-case/access-layer/authorized-query.png"
  alt="Querying with permissions"
  width="1000px"
/>

If you've reached this point and followed along with everything, you should be proud! You've just created an data access
layer with Hasura that can act as a single endpoint for all your different databases. You can now use this API to build
your frontend and focus on what matters most - building your product. 🎉

## Enhanced capabilities

While everything covered above is enough to get you up and running with a data access layer, Hasura has a number of
enhanced capabilities that can help you build an ever more robust service. In this section, we'll cover some of the most
common use-cases and how you can use Hasura to solve them. We'll also provide links to more in-depth documentation so
you can learn more.

### Step 5. Connect a REST API

So far, we've looked at adding remote databases. But, what about remote APIs? For our fintech app, imagine being able to
query exchange rates using an already-existing API. With Hasura, we can connect to any REST API and use it as a data
source.

<Player src="/img/resources/use-case/access-layer/action.webm" />

<details>
  <summary>Show me how to do this</summary>
  <div>

In the `Actions` tab of our Console, click `Create` and copy and paste the block below into the `Action Definition`
field. It will take the place of all placeholder text:

```graphql
type Query {
  currencyConverter(CurrencyInfo: InputParams!): ConvertedCurrency
}
```

Then, copy and paste the block below into the `Type Configuration` field. It will take the place of all placeholder
text:

```graphql
input InputParams {
  from: String
  to: String
  amt: Int
}

type Info {
  rate: Float
}

type Query {
  amount: Int
  from: String
  to: String
}

type ConvertedCurrency {
  date: String
  info: Info
  query: Query
  result: Float
  success: Boolean
}
```

In the `Webhook Handler` field, copy and paste the following:

```text
https://api.exchangerate.host/convert
```

Click `Add Request Options Transform` and change the `Request Method` to `GET`. Add the following query parameters and
values as separate pairs in the available fields:

| Query Param | Value                               |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------- |
| from        | `{{$body.input.CurrencyInfo.from}}` |
| to          | `{{$body.input.CurrencyInfo.to}}`   |
| amount      | `{{$body.input.CurrencyInfo.amt}}`  |

Scroll to the bottom of the page, click `Create Action`, then head to your API page.

Copy and paste this query into your GraphiQL Explorer and execute the query by clicking the `Play` button.

```graphql
query CurrencyQuery {
  currencyConverter(CurrencyInfo: { amt: 1, from: "EUR", to: "USD" }) {
    result
  }
}
```

  </div>
</details>

### Step 6. Mutate data

We've given you a read-only user on these databases. However, with Hasura, you get instant GraphQL mutations for all
your data sources. This means you can create, update, and delete data from your databases using GraphQL. The same
permissions system which protects our queries also protects our mutations.
