# Quickstart with Docker

## Introduction

This guide will help you get the Hasura GraphQL engine and a Postgres
database to store its metadata running as Docker containers using Docker
Compose. This is the easiest way to set up Hasura GraphQL engine on your
**local environment**.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Step 1: Get the docker-compose file

The
[hasura/graphql-engine/install-manifests](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/tree/stable/install-manifests)
repo contains all installation manifests required to deploy Hasura
anywhere. Get the docker compose file from there:

```bash
# in a new directory run
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hasura/graphql-engine/stable/install-manifests/docker-compose/docker-compose.yaml
# or run
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hasura/graphql-engine/stable/install-manifests/docker-compose/docker-compose.yaml -o docker-compose.yml
```

## Step 2: Run Hasura GraphQL engine

The following command will run Hasura GraphQL engine along with a
Postgres database to store its metadata.

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
```

Check if the containers are running:

```bash
$ docker ps

CONTAINER ID IMAGE                 ... CREATED STATUS PORTS          ...
097f58433a2b hasura/graphql-engine ... 1m ago  Up 1m  8080->8080/tcp ...
b0b1aac0508d postgres              ... 1m ago  Up 1m  5432/tcp       ...
```

## Step 3: Connect a database

Head to `http://localhost:8080/console` to open the Hasura console.

Navigate to `Data -> Manage -> Connect Database`:

Enter your database connection URL. _(See the note below if you do not
have an existing database)_

Click `Connect Database`.

:::info Starting from scratch

If you are looking to start setting up a backend from scratch, we
recommend using Postgres as the database.

If you do not have an existing Postgres database, you can choose to
connect to the Postgres database that was created along with Hasura (to
store its metadata) and use it as a data source as well. The
docker-compose file has an additional env var `PG_DATABASE_URL` which
points to the created metadata database. You can use this env var to
connect the same database as a data source and continue.

## Step 4: Try out Hasura

<!-- TODO: add options to track existing vs create new tables -->

### Create a table

On the Hasura console, navigate to `Data -> Create table` and create a
sample table called `profiles` with the following columns:

```sql
profiles (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, -- serial -> auto-incrementing integer
  name TEXT
)
```

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/graphql/core/getting-started/create-profile-table.png"
  alt="Create a table"
  width="1200px"
/>

Now, insert some sample data into the table using the `Insert Row` tab
of the `profiles` table.

### Try out a query

Head to the `GraphiQL` tab in the console and try running the following
query:

```graphql
query {
  profiles {
    id
    name
  }
}
```

You'll see that you get all the inserted data!

### Stay up to date

We release new features every month. Sign up for our newsletter by using
the link below. We send newsletters only once a month.

### Database operations

- [Database modelling](/graphql/core/databases/postgres/schema/index.mdx): Learn how to model your database
  schema, as well as how to extend it.
- [Querying data](/graphql/core/databases/postgres/queries/index.mdx): Use GraphQL queries to query data from
  your GraphQL API.
- [Inserting data](/graphql/core/databases/postgres/mutations/index.mdx): Use GraphQL mutations to insert
  data into your GraphQL API.

### Business logic

There are several options for the implementation of business logic,
depending on your use case.

- [Actions](/graphql/core/actions/index.mdx): Actions can be used if you'd like to extend
  your GraphQL schema by integrating with a REST endpoint.
- [Remote schemas](/graphql/core/remote-schemas/index.mdx): If you have an existing GraphQL
  server or if you're comfortable with implementing one, you can use
  remote schemas.
- [Event triggers](/graphql/core/event-triggers/index.mdx): To trigger a serverless function
  based on a database event, use event triggers.
- [Scheduled triggers](/graphql/core/scheduled-triggers/index.mdx): Scheduled triggers are
  used to execute custom business logic at specific points in time.

### Migrations

Set up [Hasura migrations](/graphql/core/migrations/migrations-setup.mdx) to track your database
alterations. This will make it easier to move to a different environment
(e.g. staging or prod) later.

### Secure your endpoint

[Add an admin secret](/graphql/core/deployment/deployment-guides/docker.mdx#docker-secure) to make sure that your GraphQL
endpoint and the Hasura console are not publicly accessible.

## Detailed Docker setup

This was a quickstart guide to get the Hasura GraphQL engine up and
running quickly. For more detailed instructions on deploying using
Docker, check out [Run Hasura GraphQL engine using Docker](/graphql/core/deployment/deployment-guides/docker.mdx).
