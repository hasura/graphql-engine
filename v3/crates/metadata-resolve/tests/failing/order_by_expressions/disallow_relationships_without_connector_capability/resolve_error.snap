The following issues were raised but disallowed by compatibility configuration:

Issue in order by expression 'MyOrderByExpression (in subgraph default)' used by model 'mymodel (in subgraph default)': The orderable relationship 'SecondRowTypeRelationship' defined for 'RowType (in subgraph default)' is not supported in ordering because the data connector 'myconnector (in subgraph default)' does not support relationships
