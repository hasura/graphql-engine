# Get Started

<ProductBadge self />

## Prerequisites

1. Hasura Enterprise Edition can be deployed as a single Docker container and so to install and use this product, you
   will need a container platform (e.g. Docker, Kubernetes, AWS ECS, Google CloudRun, Azure Containers).

2. Hasura Enterprise Edition depends on the following software for its features. We highly recommend using managed
   instances from your cloud or infrastructure provider.

   - **PostgreSQL database (v10 or above)** to store your Metadata (just like Hasura CE).
   - **(Optional) Redis database (v5 or above) for setting up query response caching**.
