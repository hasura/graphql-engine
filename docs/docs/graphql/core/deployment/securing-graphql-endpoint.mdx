# Securing the GraphQL endpoint

To make sure that your GraphQL endpoint and the Hasura console are not
publicly accessible, you need to configure an admin secret key.

Depending on your deployment method, follow one of these guides to
configure an admin secret key, and prevent public access to your GraphQL
endpoint and the Hasura console:

-   Hasura Cloud projects have a randomly generated admin secret added
    by default at the time of creation.
-   [For Heroku](/graphql/core/deployment/deployment-guides/heroku.mdx#heroku-secure)
-   [For Docker](/graphql/core/deployment/deployment-guides/docker.mdx#docker-secure)
-   [For Kubernetes](/graphql/core/deployment/deployment-guides/kubernetes.mdx#kubernetes-secure)
-   [For Digital Ocean](/graphql/core/deployment/deployment-guides/digital-ocean-one-click.mdx#digital-ocean-secure)

:::info Note

If you're looking at adding access control rules for your data to your
GraphQL API then head to [Authentication / access control](/graphql/core/auth/index.mdx).
