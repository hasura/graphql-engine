# Get Started with Hasura Cloud & Citus - Hyperscale

## Try it out

### Step 1: Create an account on Hasura Cloud and create a new Hasura Project

Navigate to [cloud.hasura.io](https://cloud.hasura.io/signup/?pg=docs&plcmt=body&cta=navigate-to-cloud-hasura-io&tech=default),
and create a new Hasura Cloud account.

Once you create a project on Hasura Cloud, hit the "Launch Console"
button to open the Hasura Console for your project.

### Step 2: Add your Citus database as a source to Hasura

In the `Data > Data Manager > Connect Existing Database` section on the
console, select `Citus` from the `Data Source Driver` dropdown and add
the connection string directly or through an environment variable. As
Citus speaks the same protocol as Postgres, the connection string will
start with `postgres://`, i.e, there is no difference between Citus’s
connection strings and Postgres’s connection strings.

/>

Once you add the database, you'll see your database pop up on the sidebar.

### Step 3: Track existing tables or create new tables

If you have existing tables, head to the database page by clicking on
the database name on the sidebar. You should see a list of tables.

      :width: 1000px

-->

Track tables selectively or all of them so that Hasura can introspect
the tables and create the corresponding GraphQL schema.

-->

If you have foreign keys, you'll also see suggested relationships.
Again, you can choose to track them selectively or all at once.

-->

If you don't have existing tables, go ahead and add new tables and data
and try out some queries, just like with a regular Postgres database.

<!--

   Step 3: Option 2: Create new tables
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   If you don't have existing tables, head to the Run SQL window
   to run SQL against your SQL Server database and create tables or hit the Create Table button
   to create a table.

   If you're running raw SQL queries to create your tables, Don't forget to check "track metadata"
   at the bottom of the Run SQL window to make sure Hasura tracks your new database objects 
   in its GraphQL schema.

### Step 4: Try out a GraphQL query

Head to the `GraphiQL` tab in the console and try running a GraphQL
query! Use the explorer sidebar on GraphQL to get help in creating a
GraphQL query.

## Keep up to date

Hasura supports queries, relationships, permissions, functions and
mutations on Citus.

Please watch this space to get the latest docs on how you can try these
features out via the console or by manipulating metadata in JSON/YAML directly.
