# EE: SSO Through SAML <HeadingIcon icon={`ee`} size={36} />

## Introduction

You can enable SSO with your identity management system through the

<a href='http://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/Post2.0/sstc-saml-tech-overview-2.0.html' target='__blank'>
  SAML 2.0
</a>
protocol. Hasura Pro is a SAML 2.0 compliant service provider.

### Configuration

#### Configuring the identity provider

Create a new service provider on your SAML identity provider with the following configuration:

1. Configure the ACS URL, Entity ID, Recipient and Audience to be the lux callback URL.

   1. For path based deployments (`global.subDomain: false`), the lux callback URL is
      `https://<LUX_DOMAIN>/auth/saml/callback`.
   2. For sub-domain based deployments (`global.subDomain: true`), the lux callback URL is
      `https://auth.<LUX_DOMAIN>/saml/callback`.

2. Set the NameID format to `email address`.

Once created, note the metadata in XML format. Dynamic metadata through IdP metadata URL is also supported.

#### Configuring lux as the service provider

1. Ensure the `configs.authMethods` is set to `saml` in the overrides file / configmap.

2. If you require SAML AuthN requests to be signed, configure the auth service with a keypair,
   [steps](/enterprise/control-plane/helm-configs.mdx#saml-request-signing-certs-configuration).

3. Insert a row in the `saml_idp` table in lux database to add the IdP configuration to lux. Go to
   `https://data.<LUX_DOMAIN>` and run the following mutation from the console:

   ```graphql
   mutation insertSamlIdp {
     insert_saml_idp_one(
       object: {
         domain: "okta.com"
         idp_metadata_xml: "<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"xml>\n<md:EntityDescr...."
         provider: "okta"
         disable_request_signing: false
       }
     ) {
       id
     }
   }
   ```

- `domain`: Domain tied to the email address of the users using SSO. If the emails of the users are tied to more than
  one domain, make the same mutation multiple times while changing the `domain` value.
- `idp_metadata_xml`: Metadata of your identity provider in XML format. If you want to configure the metadata through a
  dynamic URL, you can keep this field empty and enter the metadata URL in the `idp_metadata_url` field.
- `provider`: The name of this identity provider
- `disable_request_signing`: Set this field to `true` if you want the SAML assertion request to be un-signed. (Default
  value is `false`)

### Caveats and limitations

1. Only SP initiated flow is supported i.e. you can't have a `Launch` button in your IdP dashboard to launch the project
   dashboard.
2. Session expiry time is currently not configurable.
3. Single logout is currently not supported.
4. Once SSO is enabled for an org, it is enforced for that org. This means, if an org is enabled for SSO, the emails
   from that org cannot use any other login mechanism such as google, github or email.
5. Currently, only SAML with HTTP Post binding is supported.
