# Hasura Feature Names

* Hasura feature names should all use Title Case.
* Concepts such as "data federation", "authentication, "mutations", "connection pools" are not features and don't
need to be capitalised.
* If the name is written without the "Hasura" prefix it still needs to have a cap.
* An extensive list of feature names is below:
  * Hasura API
  * Hasura Actions
  * Hasura CLI
  * Hasura Cloud
  * Hasura Console
  * Hasura Enterprise
  * Hasura Event Triggers
  * Hasura GraphQL API Explorer
  * Hasura GraphQL Engine
  * Hasura Health Check
  * Hasura Metadata
  * Hasura Migrations
  * Hasura Monitoring
  * Hasura Community Edition
  * Hasura OSS
  * Hasura Preview Apps
  * Hasura Projects
  * Hasura Remote Schemas
  * Hasura Scheduled Triggers
  * Hasura Seeds
  * Hasura Source Health Check
* Always capitalize 3rd party products appropriately, e.g: PostgreSQL, MS SQL Server, BigQuery.
