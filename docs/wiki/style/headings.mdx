# Headings

- Headings should use `Title Capitalization Like This`.
- Subheadings, anything less than `h1` or markdown level 1: `#`, should use `Sentence capitalization like this`.
- Subheadings which are numbered steps to follow should start with `Step 0:`.
- Subheadings which are numbered steps should have the first word after the colon capitalized like this: `Step 0: Do something great`.
- Headings should not end with a period.
- Leave a blank line above and below headings.
- Use the infinitive verb form in all types of headings (correct: "Try out Hasura permissions", wrong: "Trying out Hasura permissions").
- Add an introduction section as `## Introduction` with a short overview of what the page is about.
- Page titles should be self-sufficient. Users might not have the context of the hierarchy of the page in the docs tree.
  A user can land on a page via search as well. e.g. Say you are adding a new deployment guide for AWS under
  `Guides -> Deployment -> AWS`. The title of this page should not be just `AWS` but instead
  `AWS deployment guide for Hasura GraphQL Engine`. It's ok to alias it to just `AWS` in the sidebar
  (`sidebar_label: AWS`) as there the user has the context of the page hierarchy.
