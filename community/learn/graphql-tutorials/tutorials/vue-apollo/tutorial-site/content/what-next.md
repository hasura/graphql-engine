Congratulations! You have successfully completed the course.

In case you are wondering what to do next, you have the following options:

## Take the Hasura backend course
 We have an [Introduction to Hasura](https://learn.hasura.io/graphql/hasura) backend course to build the backend that you just used for your vue app.

## Join Discord for Support
We have a Discord Channel for those who are new to GraphQL. Please post your queries or feedback regarding this course. It is a pretty active channel.

Here's the [invite link](https://discordapp.com/invite/vBPpJkS) to join discord.

## More boilerplates
We have a bunch of sample apps created using Vue, Apollo Client and Hasura GraphQL Engine.

Check out the [vue-graphql](https://hasura.io/vue-graphql) page to get a taste of how realtime GraphQL and Auth work with Hasura. We also have boilerplates to help you get started quickly with Vue and Apollo.
