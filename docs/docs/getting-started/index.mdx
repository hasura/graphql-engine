# Getting Started

## Introduction

To use the Hasura GraphQL Engine, you'll need to:

- Deploy the Hasura GraphQL engine, with access to a Postgres database to store its metadata.
- Connect new/existing database(s) and set up and test your GraphQL API using the Hasura console UI (also possible via
  CLI or API).
- Consume the generated GraphQL API from your client apps.

You have a couple of options when getting started.

### Hasura Cloud

[Hasura Cloud](https://cloud.hasura.io) is the preferred choice when getting started. Hasura Cloud is a hosted service
for Hasura GraphQL Engine projects with added features for reliability and security. If you're looking for the least
friction between trying out Hasura and moving into production,
[check out this quickstart guide](/getting-started/getting-started-cloud.mdx) and **get started for free**.

### Docker Compose

Alternatively, if you'd like to get a local version up and running that you can eventually deploy to a host of your
choice, [check out our quickstart using Docker Compose](/getting-started/docker-simple.mdx). At its heart, Hasura is
open-source and within minutes you'll have a fully functional Hasura GraphQL Engine instance running locally with which
you can experiment. If you're looking to learn more about Hasura GraphQL Engine's core features and see if it's right
for you, consider this option.

### Supported databases

Regardless of which option above you choose, Hasura GraphQL Engine supports:

- [Postgres](/databases/postgres/index.mdx)
- [MS SQL Server](/databases/ms-sql-server/index.mdx)
- [Citus / Hyperscale](/databases/postgres/citus-hyperscale-postgres/index.mdx)
- [BigQuery](/databases/bigquery/index.mdx)
- **MySQL** (in preview) - See the [preview guide](/databases/mysql/getting-started.mdx)
