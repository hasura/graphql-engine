# Operations

## Terminology

**Operation**  
Any GraphQL (query, mutation, subscription) request made to v1/graphql endpoint of a GraphQL engine instance

**Operation name**  
(Optional) Any GraphQL request can be labelled with a name by the client making the query. In this example, _getPollOptions_ is the operation name:

```graphql
query getPollOptions (
  poll {
    options {
      id
      name
      description
    }
  }
}
```

**Operation ID**  
A unique, auto-generated hash for each Operation name; can distinguish between different operations executed with the same name

**Operation type**  
Whether the operation is a query, mutation, or subscription

**Request ID**  
A unique, auto-generated ID for each request, comes from x-request-id HTTP header

**Websocket ID**  
A unique ID generated by the server when a websocket connection is established by the client

**Websocket Operation ID**  
A unique ID generated by the websocket client for each operation it is sending to the server

## Sorting operations

Each column in the **Operations List** can be sorted (ascending or descending) just by clicking on it. Very useful for identifying operations with unusually high execution time or response size!
