# Components-Driven Development - The WorkfLow

The workflow we use will lean on three aspects (elaborated below):

1. **Code generation**: Using code generation tools to create a consistent pattern of folders, files, and tests
2. **Component driven design**: Building using a "component driven approach", starting with smaller components and building up to larger components and pages
3. **Collaboration**: Following a visual testing strategy that uses chromatic to automatically catch changes and capture snapshots and then reviewing these as a team online.

### Creating new components/features

1. **File system**

- This is the file system with the relevant files and folders for the new component or feature complete with stories and tests.

- When the tool is run a file structure similar to this will be generated:

```md
src/features/awesome-feature
|
+-- api # exported API request declarations and api hooks related to a specific feature
|
+-- assets # assets folder can contain all the static files for a specific feature
|
+-- components # components scoped to a specific feature
--|
--+-- MyComponent
----|
----+-- MyComponent.tsx
----|
----+-- hooks # hooks scoped to this component
----|
----+-- index.ts # entry point for the component
|
+-- hooks # hooks scoped to a specific feature
|
+-- stores # state stores for a specific feature
|
+-- types # typescript types for ta specific feature domain
|
+-- utils # utility functions for a specific feature
|
+-- index.ts # entry point for the feature, it should serve as the public API of the given feature and exports everything that should be used outside the feature
```

2. **Build components in storybooks**

- Once the new files had been scaffolded using code gen tools the new feature should be build out and tested in storybooks.
- We should follow a "Component Driven Design" approach. This generally means 2 things:
  1. Start with the smallest components and build up to larger components and pages composed of the smaller components
  2. Stories are tests! When creating new components we should be following a Test Driven Development pattern, this doesn't neccessarily mean writing tests with `jest`/`react-testing-library` for every component. By following a iterative process and checking story output as we go we are naturally following Test Driven Development - our visual testing is the verify step.

From Storybook's visual testing handbook:

```md
test
setup
execute ðŸ‘ˆ Storybook renders stories
verify ðŸ‘ˆ you look at stories
teardown
end
```

- All stories should be checked against accessibility guidelines using the accessibility add on tab in storybooks
- We should only add tests using `react-testing-library` where components are particularly complicated in order to get the component into a hard to reach state.
- As the components increase in size/complexity they should be composed from smaller components that have already been tested and any data they need mocked using `msw` (mock service worker)
- Larger components/pages should handle their own data flow using only the minimum number of props required to fetch that data with data fetching hooks that use `react-query` under the hood. (Again the data lifecycle can be mocked using `msw`).
- Userflow testing with Cypress should be limited to key user paths and be used sparingly.

3. **Collaboration**

- Use chromatic to automate visual testing for regressions and changes
- Multiple developers check changes, and approve or reject depending on output

## Step by step

Step by step guide aimed at developers creating a feature for the first time, 'golden path' for creating new features with Test Driven Development.
The guide is to create a Form feature, this also includes use of some of the libraries and components we use such as 'react-hook-form'

### Create a feature

- Creating a new a feature: a simple form component that gathers some information about a user

- We are using Component Driven Design so will create small components and then build up to more complex components and the page as a whole.

- All sections will be mocked in Storybook including api requests

### Developing a new feature

- Run storybook `npm run storybook` and go to `http://localhost:6006` in the browser

- Create a new component `UserInfo` in the components folder. The component is going to be a simple collection of user input fields.

We will be using `react-hook-form` so the component needs to be registered

```tsx
// components/UserInfo.tsx

import React from 'react';
import { useFormContext } from 'react-hook-form';

import { InputField } from '@/new-components/Form';

export const UserInfo = () => {
  const { register } = useFormContext();

  return (
    <div>
      <InputField
        label="Name"
        placeholder="Your name here"
        {...register('name')}
      />
    </div>
  );
};
```

- Create a new story along side the component

```tsx
// components/UserInfo.stories.tsx

import React from 'react';
import { Story, Meta } from '@storybook/react';
import { UserInfo } from './UserInfo';

export default {
  // the title determines how the component will appear in the storybook menu
  title: 'Example/User Info',
  component: UserInfo,
} as Meta;

// anything exported will be displayed in storybooks
export const Primary: Story = args => <UserInfo {...args} />;
```

- Visit `http://localhost:6006` and go to `Example/User Info` from the menu

You will see the message `Cannot read properties of null (reading 'register')`

This is because the `InputField` component must be implemented within a `Form` component, we can fix this is storybook by adding a decorator

Let's fix this:

```tsx
// components/UserInfo.tsx

import React from 'react';
import { Story, Meta } from '@storybook/react';
import { z } from 'zod';
import { Form } from '@/new-components/Form';

import { UserInfo } from './UserInfo';

export default {
  title: 'Example/User Info',
  component: UserInfo,
  decorators: [
    (S: React.FC) => (
      <Form schema={z.any()} onSubmit={() => {}}>
        {() => <S />}
      </Form>
    ),
  ],
} as Meta;

export const Primary: Story = args => <UserInfo {...args} />;
```

The component should now load in storybook:

![image info](./assets/user-info1.png)

```md
This is the basic method for Test Driven Development with storybooks: update the component, visually check in storybook, iterate
```

- Add some more fields to the `UserInfo`

```tsx
// components/UserInfo.tsx

import React from 'react';
import { useFormContext } from 'react-hook-form';

import { InputField } from '@/new-components/Form';

export const UserInfo = () => {
  const { register } = useFormContext();

  return (
    <div className="grid gap-2">
      <InputField
        label="Name"
        placeholder="Your name here"
        {...register('name')}
      />

      <InputField
        label="User Name"
        placeholder="Your username here"
        {...register('username')}
      />

      <InputField
        label="Email"
        placeholder="you@website.com"
        type="email"
        {...register('email')}
      />

      <InputField
        label="Phone Number"
        placeholder="Your phone number"
        {...register('phoneNumber')}
      />
    </div>
  );
};
```

- Check the rendered output in storybook

![image info](./assets/user-info2.png)

- Now that we have one component correctly rendering let's create another component using the same workflow as before:

```tsx
// components/CompanyInfo.tsx

import React from 'react';
import { useFormContext } from 'react-hook-form';

import { InputField } from '@/new-components/Form';

export const CompanyInfo = () => {
  const { register } = useFormContext();

  return (
    <div className="grid gap-2">
      <InputField
        label="Company name"
        placeholder="Your company name here"
        {...register('companyName')}
      />

      <InputField
        label="Company Website"
        placeholder="www.yourcompanywebsite.com"
        {...register('website')}
      />

      <InputField
        label="Sector"
        placeholder="Your company sector e.g. software"
        {...register('secotr')}
      />
    </div>
  );
};
```

```tsx
// components/CompanyInfo.stories.tsx

import React from 'react';
import { Story, Meta } from '@storybook/react';
import { z } from 'zod';
import { Form } from '@/new-components/Form';

import { CompanyInfo } from './CompanyInfo';

export default {
  title: 'Example/Company Info',
  component: CompanyInfo,
  decorators: [
    (S: React.FC) => (
      <Form schema={z.any()} onSubmit={() => {}}>
        {() => <S />}
      </Form>
    ),
  ],
} as Meta;

export const Primary: Story = args => <CompanyInfo {...args} />;
```

```md
Now that we have 2 smaller components correctly rendering in storybooks, we can start to move up the Component hirachy and compose these 2 components into a larger `form` component. Again this will be rendered and tested in storybooks.

The component will be responsible for its entire data lifecycle and we will use `msw` to mock this in storybook.
```

- Create a `Form` component and compose the two smaller components within it

```tsx
// components/ExampleForm.tsx

import React from 'react';
import { z } from 'zod';

import { Form } from '@/new-components/Form';
import { CompanyInfo } from './CompanyInfo';
import { UserInfo } from './UserInfo';

// we use zod to allow us to define the schema for the form output
const schema = z.object({
  name: z.string(),
  username: z.string(),
  email: z.string().email(),
  phoneNumber: z.string(),
  companyName: z.string(),
  website: z.string(),
  sector: z.string(),
});

// z.infer allows the schema to converted to a TS type
type FormOutput = z.infer<typeof schema>;

export const ExampleForm = () => {
  const handleSubmit = (formOutput: FormOutput) => {
    // we'll log the form output to ensure it's correct
    console.log(formOutput);
  };

  return (
    <Form schema={schema} onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      {() => (
        <>
          <p className="font-bold">User Info</p>
          <UserInfo />
          <p className="font-bold">Company Info</p>
          <CompanyInfo />
          <Button type="submit" mode="primary">
            Submit
          </Button>
        </>
      )}
    </Form>
  );
};
```

```tsx
// components/ExampleForm.stories.tsx

import React from 'react';
import { Story, Meta } from '@storybook/react';

import { ExampleForm } from './ExampleForm';

export default {
  title: 'Example/Example Form',
  component: ExampleForm,
} as Meta;

export const Primary: Story = args => <ExampleForm {...args} />;
```

```md
This time we don't need to use a decorator as the Form is being implemented in the component
```

- Check the component in storybook to ensure it is rendering properly:

![image info](./assets/example-form.png)

- Check the form output in the console it should look something like this:

```js
{
  companyName: "Comp",
  email: "me@g.com",
  name: "Me",
  phoneNumber: "01234587887",
  sector: "software",
  username: "me",
  website: "www.comp.com"
}
```

- We now have a larger component composed of base components correctly rendering in storybook, the next stage is to mock the dataflow. In the console we use `react-query` and a custom Api function imported from `@/hooks/apiUtils`. Let's set this up:

```tsx
// components/ExampleForm.tsx

import React from 'react';
// import useMutation from react query
import { useMutation } from 'react-query';
import { z } from 'zod';

// import Api from our custom hooks
import { Api } from '@/hooks/apiUtils';

import { Button } from '@/new-components/Button';
import { Form } from '@/new-components/Form';
import { CompanyInfo } from './CompanyInfo';
import { UserInfo } from './UserInfo';

const schema = z.object({
  name: z.string(),
  username: z.string(),
  email: z.string().email(),
  phoneNumber: z.string(),
  companyName: z.string(),
  website: z.string(),
  sector: z.string(),
});

type FormOutput = z.infer<typeof schema>;

interface ApiResponse {
  status: 'success' | 'error';
  body: FormOutput;
}

export const ExampleForm = () => {
  // on submit the form will try to submit to the relative path api/user-info
  const { mutateAsync } = useMutation(
    // we can specify the input and response types for the api
    (body: FormOutput) =>
      Api.post<ApiResponse>(
        { headers: {}, body, url: 'api/user-info' },
        result => result
      ),
    {
      mutationKey: 'userInfo',
    }
  );

  const handleSubmit = (formOutput: FormOutput) => {
    mutateAsync(formOutput);
  };

  return (
    <Form schema={schema} onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      {() => (
        <>
          <p className="font-bold">User Info</p>
          <UserInfo />
          <p className="font-bold">Company Info</p>
          <CompanyInfo />
          <Button type="submit" mode="primary">
            Submit
          </Button>
        </>
      )}
    </Form>
  );
};
```

- If we now try to run this in storybooks we get the following error: `No QueryClient set, use QueryClientProvider to set one`. We need to add another decorator to get `react-query` to work

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { Story, Meta } from '@storybook/react';
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from 'react-query';

import { ExampleForm } from './ExampleForm';

const queryClient = new QueryClient();

export default {
  title: 'Example/Example Form',
  component: ExampleForm,
  decorators: [
    (S: React.FC) => (
      // wrap stories in QueryClientProvider
      <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
        <S />
      </QueryClientProvider>
    ),
  ],
} as Meta;

export const Primary: Story = args => <ExampleForm {...args} />;
```

- The story should now load correctly, however we now get the following error in the console when we try to submit the form `POST http://localhost:6006/api/user-info 404 (Not Found)`. We will now implement `mock service worker` to catch and respond to the api request:

```tsx
// components/ExampleForm.tsx

import React from 'react';
// import the rest client from msw
import { rest } from 'msw';
import { Story, Meta } from '@storybook/react';
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from 'react-query';

import { ExampleForm } from './ExampleForm';

const queryClient = new QueryClient();

export default {
  title: 'Example/Example Form',
  component: ExampleForm,
  decorators: [
    (S: React.FC) => (
      <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
        <S />
      </QueryClientProvider>
    ),
  ],
} as Meta;

const url = 'http://localhost:6006';

export const Primary: Story = args => <ExampleForm {...args} />;
// we can mock responses from different endpoints by providing an array of
// responses under the msw key
Primary.parameters = {
  msw: [
    rest.post(`${url}/api/user-info`, (req, res, ctx) => {
      return res(ctx.json({ status: 'success', body: req.body }));
    }),
  ],
};
```

- We can now see that when we submit the form and check the console msw responds with a `200` status: `[MSW] 16:24:05 POST /api/user-info (200)`.
  Let's now add some logic to the form to react to the response:

```tsx
// components/ExampleForm.tsx
...

if (data?.status === "success") {
  return <div>Form successfully submitted for {data.body.name}</div>;
}

...
```

- And check that it renders correctly in storybook

![image info](./assets/success-message.png)

- We can also add an error test case while we're at it:

```tsx
// components/ExampleForm.stories.tsx

export const Error: Story = args => <ExampleForm {...args} />;
// we can mock responses from different endpoints by providing an array of
// responses under the msw key
Error.parameters = {
  msw: [
    rest.post(`${url}/api/user-info`, (req, res, ctx) => {
      return res(
        ctx.status(500),
        ctx.json({
          status: 'error',
          errorMessage: 'Some server error',
          body: req.body,
        })
      );
    }),
  ],
};
```

```tsx
// components/ExampleForm.tsx
...
  if (error) {
      return <div>With much regret there was an error</div>
  }
...
```

- Finally check the error message renders correctly:

![image info](./assets/error-message.png)

### Collaboration and testing

- Once we are happy with our new feature we can push our changes and create a pull request
- Chromatic is set to run on each push and will capture screenshots of any stories we have created
- On future pull requests chromatic will compare screenshots to their accepted baselines and notify reviewers of any visual changes which they are then able to accept or reject
- Once all changes have been confirmed and a code review has been completed our new feature can be merged
