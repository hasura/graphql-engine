-- This configuration is just for building haddocks in CI. `cabal haddock` requires
-- the project to be built. We can do that at the end of the build job, but that
-- adds ~7min wall clock time to CI, since haddock is extremely slow.
--     Instead we make this a parallel job, but use a configuration with optimizations
-- off so the haskell build will be relatively fast.

-- NOTE!: we want to make sure this matches `ci.project.local`, so we can re-use the
-- cached library dependencies and don't accidentally rebuild:

  ghc-options:
    -j2

  library-vanilla: False
