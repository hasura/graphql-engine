## Introduction

You can connect your front-end [Vercel](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
applications with a [Hasura Cloud](https://cloud.hasura.io/) project.

This integration does the following:

-   Creates a new Hasura Cloud project which can serve as a unified
    back-end for one or more front-end applications i.e. Vercel Projects
    depending on the scope of the integration.

-   Configures necessary project settings i.e setting environment
    variables and exposing them on the client side. (Check the
    `list <vercel_environment_variables>` of all environment variables
    set).

## Creating an Integration

You can configure the [official Hasura
integration](https://vercel.com/integrations/hasura-v1) with your Vercel
account.

    integration](https://vercel.com/integrations/hasura-v1) page and
    click on `Add Integration`.

### Step 3: Select Integration Scope

-   Select the integration scope.

    | Scope             | Description                                        |
    |-------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
    | All Projects      | Configures all Vercel applications in the account. |

    </div>

-   Click on `Add Integration` and a new window should pop up for the
    further steps specific to Hasura Cloud.

### Step 4: Configure Hasura Cloud

-   You'll be directed towards a Hasura Cloud signup or login page. This
    is skipped if you are already logged-in to Hasura Cloud.

-   Once you are logged in, a Hasura Cloud project is created for the
    integration and the required
    `environment variables <vercel_environment_variables>` are set for
    each Vercel project in the scope.

    </div>

-   Click on the first link to navigate to your Hasura Cloud project
    Console to configure your GraphQL API and connect to a database.
    Check out the section on `database setup <cloud_projects_db_setup>`
    on how to do this.

    <div class="thumbnail" alt="Visit Console Button" width="600px">

    /img/graphql/cloud/integrations/vercel/integration-complete.png

    </div>

-   Click on `Configure` to navigate to Cloud Dashboard to see the
    latest project we created for you. This will be a project with the
    tag `Vercel` on it.

    <div class="thumbnail" alt="Integration Complete" width="1146px">

    /img/graphql/cloud/integrations/vercel/vercel-tag-project.png

    </div>

-   To change the scope of you integration, you can click on
    `Manage Access` to add/remove vercel applications from the
    integration. Check out the `vercel_change_scope` section for more
    details.

## Environment variables

-   List of Hasura Cloud environment variables configured by the
    integration for each Vercel application in the scope of the
    integration:

    | Title                               | Description                                                       |
    |-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | HASURA_PROJECT_ENDPOINT             | GraphQL API endpoint of the Hasura Cloud project.                 |
    | NEXT_PUBLIC_HASURA_PROJECT_ENDPOINT | GraphQL API endpoint to be exposed on the Next.js browser client. |
    | HASURA_ADMIN_SECRET                 | Admin secret key to access your GraphQL API.                      |

    -   You can check the environment variables configured by the
        integration for you in the respective Vercel Project's settings
        on Vercel dashboard. These are set up for `Development`,
        `Preview` and `Production` environments. Check the [Vercel
        docs](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/environment-variables)
        for environment variables for further reference.

        </div>

<div class="note">

<div class="title">

Note

</div>

-   If a `custom domain <manage_project_domains>` is added to the Hasura
    Cloud project, you'll have to set this custom value to
    `HASURA_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` and `NEXT_HASURA_PROJECT_ENDPOINT`
    manually in the respective Vercel project's settings.
-   Similarly if the Hasura Cloud project's admin secret is changed, you
    will have to edit the `HASURA_ADMIN_SECRET` manually in the
    respective Vercel project's settings.

</div>

## Adding and removing projects from the Scope of Integration

Once the integration is installed, you can change the scope of the
integration.

-   Navigate to the installed integration page and click on
    `Manage Access`. This will show you the current status of the
    integration, i.e the projects that are currently configured.

    <div class="thumbnail" alt="Manage Access Button" width="1146px">

    /img/graphql/cloud/integrations/vercel/manage-access-button.png

    </div>

-   If the integration is installed for `All Projects`, you can change
    the scope to `Specific Projects` and select the projects from the
    dropdown you want to keep the integration on. If installed for
    `Specific Projects`, you can add individual projects from the
    dropdown or remove them from the list.

    <div class="thumbnail" alt="Manage Access For Projects"
    width="400px">

    /img/graphql/cloud/integrations/vercel/manage-access-projects.png

    </div>

-   Click on `Save` to save the changes.

<div class="note">

<div class="title">

Note

</div>

Hasura Cloud project's environment variables will be automatically set
for the added projects and will be removed for the removed projects.

## Removing an Integration

-   To remove the configured integration, navigate to the `Integrations`
    sections in Vercel Dashboard and spot the Hasura integration in the
    list. Click on `Manage` to navigate to the integration page.

    <div class="thumbnail" alt="Vercel Integration Tab" width="1146px">

    /img/graphql/cloud/integrations/vercel/integration-tab.png

    </div>

-   Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click on
    `Remove Integration`. Vercel will remove the integration along with
    the set environment variables from the applications.

    <div class="thumbnail" alt="Remove Vercel Integration"
    width="1146px">

    </div>

Your Hasura Cloud project will not be affected.
