#### Cloud

Admin UI, where user will login/signup etc. and where user can create/manage projects. Data service acts as the primary
backend for the UI.

#### Auth

The Auth service, built on top of [authboss](https://github.com/volatiletech/authboss/). This service powers all the
authentication APIs (password and social logins) and the auth webhooks of Data and Metrics (Hasura CE) services. Also,
adds auxiliary functionality around authentication like password recovery/change, etc,.

#### API

This microservice executes various business logic and is added as Remote schema and Event triggers to Data service. The
following endpoints are exposed:

- `/events`: Event triggers used by Hasura for sending emails etc.
- `/graphql`: Remote schema exposed by Hasura for custom logic.
- `/scheduler`: API execute certain tasks like cleaning up old logs, called by `cronjob`

#### Auth-Redis

This Redis instance is used to store the cookie for faster lookups and is used by Auth Service.

#### Logs-monitor

In older versions of lux, this service is called `Cronjob`. It periodically calls `/scheduler` APIs (of API service) to
execute actions like deleting old logs etc.

#### Data

This is a Hasura CE fronting the Postgres DB. This is the backend for the Admin / Dashboard UI serving project and user
data, etc.

#### Logs-gRPC

Although the service is named logs-grpc , it is able to support HTTP/WS/gRPC protocols. Graphql-Engine-Pro uses HTTP
protocol to send logs. This service receives the logs, parses them and buffers them in logs-redis in-memory queue.

#### Logs-Redis

This Redis instance is used as an in-memory buffer during logs ingestion pipeline. The logs are fed in by logs-grpc
service and consumed by logs-worker service.

#### Logs-worker

Logs-worker service continuously fetches logs from logs-redis and inserts them into the timescale DB.

#### Metrics

This is a Hasura CE fronting the Timescale DB. This is the backend for the monitoring page in the Hasura Pro console.

#### Metricsapi

This service is hooked to the metrics service as Remote schema/Event trigger and executes custom business logic on the
Timescale data.

#### Oauth

Powered by [hydra](https://github.com/ory/hydra), with Postgres DB as data store. Serves all the OAuth2 APIs required
for authenticating server and console on behalf of a user. The primary functionality of this service is to validate
tokens from various services.

#### Postgres

Standard Postgres installation, Storing all the user data, project information, collaborators, OAuth2 data etc. Fronted
by Data (Hasura CE) service.

#### Timescale

Timeseries database (an extension on top of Postgres) to store and process Hasura Pro logs to derive metrics. Fronted by
Metrics (Hasura CE) service.

#### Email

_This is not part of the standard Hasura control plane_, but an external SMTP service
([SES](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/), Gmail, [Mailcow](https://mailcow.email/) etc,.) which is hooked into the Control
plane and is used for sending Emails in the form of signup mails, collaborator invitations, etc,.

#### Metrics Exporter

_This is not part of the standard Hasura control plane installation_. Metrics exporter is a custom solution which
integrates Hasura metrics with third party observability services. Currently, we have official exporters for
[Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/) and [NewRelic](https://newrelic.com/).
