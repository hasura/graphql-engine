## 🧰 Overview

Component description with optional links to useful docs (MDN, dedicated docs, ...).

Define the default component display (`inline`/`block`) and provided `padding`/`margins`, example:

_Default CSS display is `block`, provided without padding and margin._

### Basic usage

Provide minimal code example to use the component, example:

```ts
import { Component } from '@/new-components/Component';
```

```tsx
<Component prop1={'prop1 value'} prop2={{ item1: 'item1' }} />
```

## 🔁 States

Describe the component states and their corresponding props thanks to `<Story>`. The states are the different configuration for
one component during its lifecycle, ex:

- for an items list: empty, loading, error, with data, paginated ...
- for form input: empty, with value, disabled, with errors ...

## 🎭 Variants

Describe the components variants and their corresponding props thanks to `<Story>`. The variants are the different variations for a component, they should not be lifecycle dependent
and should be used to change the component style or behaviour, ex:

- the size of the component: small, medium, large ...
- the color of the component: primary, secondary, success, danger ...
- the orientation of the component: vertical, horizontal ...

For each variant, it is possible to add the matching use cases, example for the red variant of the `<Button>` component:

#### 🚦 Usage

Describe when a variation is eligible to be used.

## ⚙️ API

Provide a component `<Story>` with the component props `<ArgsTable>` documentation.

## 🧪 Testing

Here are special `<Story>` for testing the component.

### 🧪 Scalability

The scalability testing is to ensure the component will correctly render with very long labels, items list, image size...

### 🧪 Snapshot 📸

The snapshot `<Story>` is a merge of all stories defined in this document allowing to make only one snapshot to test them
all with Chromatic.
