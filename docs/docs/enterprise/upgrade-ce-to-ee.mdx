# Upgrading from Hasura CE to Hasura Enterprise

<div className='badge badge--primary heading-badge'>Available on: Enterprise Edition</div>

## Overview

Starting from Hasura GraphQL Engine version `v2.12.0`, we have included both open-source and commercial components in
the `hasura/graphql-engine` container image.

The `hasura/graphql-engine` image includes both open-source and proprietary components. The open-source portions are
licensed under the [Apache License, Version 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0). The proprietary
components include features for Hasura Enterprise and are enabled with a license key provided by Hasura. If you would
like to use an image with only the open source components, please use Docker images on
[this page](https://hub.docker.com/r/hasura/graphql-engine/tags?page=1&name=-ce) that contain `-ce`. (example:
`hasura/graphql-engine:<VERSION>-ce`)

If you are already running Hasura CE and would like to upgrade to Hasura Enterprise, please follow these instructions:

1. [Please contact Hasura Sales](mailto:sales@hasura.io) to obtain a license key.
2. Create an environment variable called `HASURA_GRAPHQL_EE_LICENSE_KEY` in your container platform environment and set
   it to the license key from the previous step.

   E.g. if the license key sent by Sales is `ABC1234`, you will set `HASURA_GRAPHQL_EE_LICENSE_KEY=”ABC1234”`.

3. Restart Hasura.
