title: "Create Subscription and Render Result"
---

So let's define the graphql subscription to be used.

Open `src/components/OnlineUsers/OnlineUsers.js` and add the following code, below the other imports

```
import gql from "graphql-tag";

const SUBSCRIPTION_ONLINE_USERS = gql`
  subscription {
    online_users(order_by: { name: asc }) {
      name
    }
  }
`;
```


Open `src/components/OnlineUsers/OnlineUsers.js` and add the following imports:

```
import { Subscription } from "react-apollo";
```

We are importing the `Subscription` component from `react-apollo` and the graphql subscription query we defined above to fetch the online user data.

Now, we will wrap the component with `Subscription` passing our graphql mutation constant that we imported. Replace the `return` with the following code:

```
      <Subscription subscription={SUBSCRIPTION_ONLINE_USERS}>
        {({ loading, error, data }) => {
          if (loading) {
            return <div>Loading. Please wait...</div>;
          }
          if (error) {
            return <div>Error loading users</div>;
          }
          return (
            ...your original return react code
          );
        }}
      </Subscription>
```

Now that we have the real data, let's remove the mock online user data constant.

How does this work?
-------------------
We are using the `<Subscription>` component which gives render props (similar to `<Query>` and `<Mutation>` components). The `data` prop gives the result of the realtime data for the query we have made.

Refresh your react app and see yourself online! Don't be surprised; There could be other users online as well.

Awesome! You have completed basic implementations of a GraphQL Query, Mutation and Subscriptions. Easy isn't it?
