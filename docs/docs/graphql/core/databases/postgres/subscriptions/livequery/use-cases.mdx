# Live query subscriptions sample use cases

## Introduction

The following are a few use cases for using live query subscriptions:

## Subscribe to the latest value of a particular field {#pg-subscribe-field}

In case you are interested only in the latest value of a particular
field, you can use subscriptions to fetch the field and get updated with
its latest value whenever it changes.

### Example: Live location tracking

Use subscriptions to show the current location of a vehicle on a map.

Let's say we have the following database schema:

```sql
vehicle (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  vehicle_number TEXT
)

vehicle_location (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  location TEXT,
  time_stamp TIMESTAMP with time zone DEFAULT now(),
  /* used to create relationship 'locations' for vehicle */
  vehicle_id INT FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES vehicle(id)
)
```

Now we can use the following subscription to fetch the latest location
of a vehicle to display it on a map:

<GraphiQLIDE
query={`# $vehicleId = 3
subscription getLocation($vehicleId: Int!) {
  vehicle(where: {id: {_eq: $vehicleId}}) {
    id
    vehicle_number
    locations(order_by: {time_stamp: desc}, limit: 1) {
      location
      time_stamp
    }
  }
}`}
variables={`{
  "vehicleId": 3
}`}
  response={`{
"data": {
  "vehicle": [
    {
      "id": 3,
      "vehicle_number": "KA04AD4583",
      "locations": [
        {
          "location": "(12.93623,77.61701)",
          "time_stamp": "2018-09-05T06:52:44.383588+00:00"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
}`}
/>

## Subscribe to changes to a table's entries {#pg-subscribe-table}

In case you are interested in all the additions/changes to a table's
entries, you can use subscriptions to fetch the table rows and get
live query updates whenever there are any additions/changes to the table.

### Example: Chat app

Use subscriptions to show new messages in a chatroom.

Let's say we have the following database schema:

```sql
user (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  username TEXT UNIQUE
)

message (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  texts TEXT,
  time_stamp TIMESTAMP default now(),
  /* used to create relationship 'author' with the 'user' table */
  user_id INT FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES user(id)
)
```

Now we can use the following subscription to display the latest messages
in a chatroom:

<GraphiQLIDE
  query={`subscription getMessages {
  message(order_by: {time_stamp: desc}) {
    texts
    time_stamp
    author {
      username
    }
  }
}`}
response={`{
    "data": {
      "message": [
        {
          "texts": "I am fine, and you?",
          "time_stamp": "2021-11-29T07:42:56.689135",
          "author": {
            "username": "Jane"
          }
        },
        {
          "texts": "Hi! How are you?",
          "time_stamp": "2021-11-29T07:42:19.506049",
          "author": {
            "username": "Musk"
          },
        },
        {
          "texts": "Hi!",
          "time_stamp": "2021-11-29T07:38:52.347136",
          "author": {
            "username": "Jane"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }`}
/>

## Subscribe to the latest value of some derived data {#pg-subscribe-derived}

In case you are interested in the latest value of some derived data, you
can [create a view to query the derived data](/graphql/core/databases/postgres/schema/views.mdx) and then use subscriptions to fetch the derived
value and get its latest value whenever it updates.

### Example: A poll dashboard

Use subscriptions to show the result of a poll.

Let's say we have the following database schema:

```sql
poll (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  question TEXT
)

option (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY
  poll_id INT FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES poll(id)
  texts TEXT
)

user (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY
  name TEXT
)

vote (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  option_id INT FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES option(id),
  user_id INT FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES user(id),
  time_stamp TIMESTAMP
)
```

First, create a view `poll_results` to give the result of the poll:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW public."poll_results" AS
  SELECT poll.id AS poll_id,
         o.option_id,
         count(*) AS votes
    FROM (
      (
        SELECT vote.option_id,
               option.poll_id,
               option.texts
          FROM (
            vote
              LEFT JOIN option ON ((option.id = vote.option_id))
          )
        ) o
            LEFT JOIN poll ON ((poll.id = o.poll_id))
      )
  GROUP BY poll.question, o.option_id, poll.id;
```

This view will have the following fields: `poll_id`, `option_id` and
`votes`, i.e. it gives the number of votes received by each option for a
poll.

Next, [set up relationships](/graphql/core/databases/postgres/schema/table-relationships/index.mdx) `poll` and
`option` between the `poll_results` view and the `poll` and `option`
tables using the `poll_id` and `option_id` fields respectively.

Now we can use the following subscription to display the latest poll
result:

<GraphiQLIDE
  query={`# $pollId = 1
subscription getResult($pollId: Int!) {
  poll_results (
    where: { poll_id: {_eq: $pollId} }
  ) {
    poll_id
    poll {
      question
    }
    option {
      texts
    }
    votes
  }
}`}
variables={`{
  "pollId": 1
}`}
response={`{
  "data": {
    "poll_results": [
      {
        "poll_id": 1,
        "poll":{
          "question": "What's your favourite food?"
        },
        "option": {
          "texts": "Pizza"
        },
        "votes": 1
      },
      {
        "poll_id": 1,
        "poll":{
          "question": "What's your favourite food?"
        },
        "option": {
          "texts": "Salad"
        },
        "votes": 1
      },
      {
        "poll_id": 1,
        "poll":{
          "question": "What's your favourite food?"
        },
        "option": {
          "texts": "Sandwich"
        },
        "votes": 2
      },
      {
        "poll_id": 1,
        "poll":{
          "question": "What's your favourite food?"
        },
        "option": {
          "texts": "Burger"
        },
        "votes": 3
      },
      {
        "poll_id": 1,
        "poll":{
          "question": "What's your favourite food?"
        },
        "option": {
          "texts": "Lasagna"
        },
        "votes": 1
      }
    ]
  }
}`}
/>
