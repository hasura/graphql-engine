# Jupyter Python Notebook & API Server

## Introduction

To enable quick prototyping and experimentation with AI apps, we've built a tool where you can write Python code and
expose it as an API, which can be used with Hasura Event Triggers and Actions.

This tool includes a Jupyter Notebook where Python code can be written and executed. It also comes with a Jupyter Kernel
Gateway, which can be then used to start an API out of the functions defined in the notebook.

You can use this framework to prototype your AI applications while simultaneously using Hasura Connectors to bring
together data from any data source easily and securely.

## Prerequisites

- Install the Hasura CLI: instructions can be found [here](/hasura-cli/install-hasura-cli.mdx).
- Install the `cloud` and `notebook` plugins using the following command:

```bash
hasura plugins install cloud
hasura plugins install notebook
```

To proceed, you'll need to ensure you're logged into Hasura Cloud via the CLI:

```bash
hasura cloud login
```

## Getting started

### Step 1: Create a notebook

Once you login to Hasura Cloud, you can create a Jupyter notebook to use the tool. Run the following command by
supplying any random password which you will later use to access the notebook and the API:

```bash
hasura notebook create -p <password>
```

This takes a few minutes, you can check the status using the following command:

```bash
hasura notebook status
```

When the notebook is deployed, the CLI will display the access URL. Visit the URL in a browser to see the homepage.
You will be prompted to enter a username and password. The username is `hasura` and password is the one you set while
creating the notebook:

### Step 2: Launch the notebook

Click the "Launch Notebook" button to launch the Jupyter Notebook. You should see a screen like this:

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/databases/data-connector/jupyter-contents.png"
  alt="Contents of the notebook"
/>

In the notebook, you'll find a few samples. You will find the handler code in `server.py`. This handler is responsible
for processing requests and serving responses from the API.

Once you have a block of code in your notebook, you can expose that as an API through the Jupyter Kernel Gateway by
adding a comment of the format `# METHOD /url`. For example:

```python
# GET /hello_world

import json
print(json.dumps({
  'hello': 'world'
}))
```

### Step 3: Start the API

On the homepage, click the "Start API" button. This block of code will return `{"hello": "world"}` when you visit
`/invoke/hello_world`. More details on how to handle headers and response data can be found at
[Jupyter Kernel Gateway notebook-http mode documentation](https://jupyter-kernel-gateway.readthedocs.io/en/latest/http-mode.html).

:::info Restart the API after making changes

Each time changes are made to the notebook, click the "Restart API" button to deploy the latest version.

## Templates

You can find templates for
[events and action handlers](https://github.com/hasura/jupyter-code-api-server/blob/basic-auth/notebook/server.ipynb) in
this notebook:

### Template for Event Trigger to Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) data

```python
# POST /handle_event

GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT = ""
ADMIN_SECRET = ""

import json
from gql import gql, Client
from gql.transport.requests import RequestsHTTPTransport

def handle_insert(row, client):
    id = int(row['id'])
    name = str(row['name'])
    description = str(row['description'])
    # In reality you would follow the URL from row['url']
    content = "dummy content"
    gql_query = gql("""
            mutation insertItem($id: int!, $name: text!, $description: text!) {
                insert_Product_one(object: { product_id: $id, name: $name, description: $description }) {
                    id
                }
            }
        """)
    print(client.execute(gql_query, variable_values={
        'id': id, 'name': name, 'description': description}))
```

### Template to respond to user's questions by querying Weaviate + OpenAI

```python
# POST /handle_query

GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT = ""
ADMIN_SECRET = ""
OPENAI_API_KEY = ""

import json
from gql import gql, Client
from gql.transport.requests import RequestsHTTPTransport

from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.chains import LLMChain
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate

def handle_query(request):
    user_query = request['body']['input']['user_query']

    gql_headers = dict()
    gql_headers['x-hasura-admin-secret'] = ADMIN_SECRET

    # Create a GraphQL client with the request transport
    transport = RequestsHTTPTransport(
        url=GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT, headers=gql_headers)
    client = Client(transport=transport)
```

## Authentication

The APIs exposed by the notebook require Basic HTTP authentication. When added as an Event Trigger or Action to
Hasura, you'll need to add the Authorization header in basic auth format with user name as `hasura` and password as
the password you set for the notebook.

The header format is:

```bash
Authorization: Basic <token>
```

The token can be created by base64-encoding a string in `username:password` format in your terminal:

```bash
echo -ne "<username>:<password>" | base64
```

You can then use the encoded string returned by this command as your token in the authorization header.

## Exposed APIs

The container exposes the following APIs:

| API                | Description                                            |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `/jupyter`         | Jupyter notebook entrypoint.                           |
| `/invoke/<path>`   | Invoke APIs exposed via the notebook's `server.ipynb`. |
| `/process/start`   | Start the notebook API server.                         |
| `/process/stop`    | Stop the notebook API server.                          |
| `/process/restart` | Restart the notebook API server.                       |

The source code for the container can be found [here](https://github.com/hasura/jupyter-code-api-server/tree/basic-auth).

:::info Production environments

**It is not recommended to use this notebook in production. It is intended to be a playground for experimenting and fast
iterations to validate your ideas.**

In production, we recommend that you migrate your code from a notebook and into a Flask application or equivalent,
which you can then deploy in a production-ready environment.

:::

## Deleting the notebook

Once you are done, you can keep the notebook around for your next project or delete it using the command:

```bash
hasura notebook delete
```
