# Create a One Click Deploy to Hasura Cloud App

<ProductBadge free pro ee />

## Introduction

A One Click Deploy to Hasura Cloud app enables anyone to create a Hasura Cloud Project, based on the Hasura assets
available in a GitHub repository, with a click of a `Deploy to Hasura` button. Below, you can find the step-by-step
guide to setting up a One Click Deploy to Hasura App.

## Step 1: Create a public GitHub repository with Hasura assets

One Click Deploy to Hasura Cloud applies Hasura assets, i.e. Metadata, Migrations and Seeds, from a Hasura CLI project
directory present in a public GitHub repository.

If you haven't set up a Hasura CLI project directory, follow the instructions
[here](/migrations-metadata-seeds/migrations-metadata-setup.mdx) to create one from a running Hasura instance.

The file structure of the project directory containing the Metadata, Migration, Seeds should look something like this:

```text
📂 hasura
├─ 📄 config.yaml
├─ 📂 metadata
├─ 📂 migrations
└─ 📂 seeds
```

Once the project directory is created with the application assets, push them to a public GitHub repository to be used as
the source of your One Click Deploy app.

:::info Looking for an example?

Check out what a Hasura project directory looks like with this
[e-commerce app](https://github.com/hasura/data-hub/tree/main/data-models/postgres/ecommerce/hasura).

:::

## Step 2: Add a hasura-cloud-deploy-config.yaml file (optional)

If you want to configure some extra details about the One Click Deploy app, a `hasura-cloud-deploy-config.yaml` file can
be added to the hasura assets directory (i.e., the directory containing Migrations, Metadata, and Seeds).

The file structure of the project directory with the `hasura-cloud-deploy-config.yaml` should look something like this:

```text
📂 hasura
├─ 📄 config.yaml
├─ 📂 metadata
├─ 📂 migrations
├─ 📂 seeds
└─ 📄 hasura-cloud-deploy-config.yaml
```

The `hasura-cloud-deploy-config.yaml` accepts the following fields:

- `name`: user-friendly name for your app
- `static-env`: a list of pre-configured environment variables required by the app
- `user-env`: a list of environment variables required by the app that users need to add during deployment
  - `description`: a description for the environment variable to help the user during deployment
  - `mandatory`: whether the user can skip setting the environment variable
  - `default`: _(optional)_ a default value for the environment variable which the user can override during deployment

**Example**: `hasura-cloud-deploy-config.yaml` file

```yaml
name: 'hasura-ecommerce-sample-app'

static-env:
  HASURA_GRAPHQL_UNAUTHORIZED_ROLE: anonymous

user-env:
  PG_DATABASE_URL:
    description: 'Postgres database URL'
    mandatory: true
  NEXTJS_SERVER_URL:
    default: 'http://localhost:3000'
    description: 'Next.js Server URL for authentication and custom business logic'
    mandatory: true
  HASURA_GRAPHQL_JWT_SECRET:
    default: '{"key": "this-is-the-hasura-nextjs-secret-key-replace-it-with-something-secure","type": "HS256"}'
    description: 'JWT Secret key'
    mandatory: true
```

The prompt to enter the above set of environment variables during deployment would look like the following:

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/deployment/one-click-to-deploy/user_env.png"
  alt="Initializing Hasura Cloud Project"
  width="700px"
/>

:::note Note

Adding a `hasura-cloud-deploy-config.yaml` is optional if the app doesn't need any special environment variables.

Hasura Cloud automatically detects environment variables used for database connection strings from the app metadata and
prompts users to set them even if a `hasura-cloud-deploy-config.yaml` file is not added.

Hasura Cloud also automatically sets the `HASURA_GRAPHQL_ADMIN_SECRET` environment variable to secure the project. :::

## Step 3: Add a sample-requests.graphql file (optional)

A `sample-requests.graphql` can be added to the hasura assets directory (i.e. the directory containing Migrations,
Metadata, and Seeds) to pre-fill GraphQL request(s) in the Console API explorer once the project has been set up.

The file structure of the project directory with the `sample-requests.graphql` should look something like this:

```text
📂 hasura
├─ 📄 config.yaml
├─ 📂 metadata
├─ 📂 migrations
├─ 📂 seeds
├─ 📄 hasura-cloud-deploy-config.yaml
└─ 📄 sample-requests.graphql
```

**Example**: `sample-requests.graphql` file

```graphql
query users {
  user {
    id
    name
  }
}

query usersWithOrders {
  user {
    id
    name
    orders {
      id
      status
    }
  }
}
```

This will render the Console as follows on deployment completion:

<Thumbnail src="/img/deployment/one-click-to-deploy/project_console.png" alt="Project console" width="1200px" />

## Step 4: Generate the Deployment URL and button

The following is the structure of the One Click Deploy URL which can also be linked to a `Deploy to Hasura Cloud`
button:

```html
https://cloud.hasura.io/deploy?github_repo=<LINK-TO-GIT-REPO
  >&hasura_dir=<PATH-TO-HASURA-DIRECTORY-IN-REPO>&branch=<BRANCH-NAME></BRANCH-NAME></PATH-TO-HASURA-DIRECTORY-IN-REPO
></LINK-TO-GIT-REPO>
```

### One Click Deploy URL

The following form can be used to generate a One Click Deploy to Hasura Cloud URL:

<CloudDeployURLGenerationForm />
<br />
<br />
The generated URL can now be used to trigger a One Click Deploy workflow for your app.
<br />
<br />

### Deploy to Hasura Cloud Button

You can create a `Deploy to Hasura Cloud` button as shown below that can be used to trigger a One Click Deploy workflow
for your app using the URL generated above.

![Deploy to Hasura Cloud](https://hasura.io/deploy-button.svg)

### Snippets to Embed Button

You can use the following snippets to add this button to a markdown file, such as your GitHub repository `README.md` or
your dashboards for users to deploy:

#### Markdown

```md
[![Deploy to Hasura Cloud](https://hasura.io/deploy-button.svg)](https://cloud.hasura.io/deploy?github_repo=<LINK-TO-GIT-REPO>&hasura_dir=<PATH-TO-HASURA-DIRECTORY-IN-REPO>&branch=<BRANCH-NAME>)
```

#### HTML

```html
<a
  href="https://cloud.hasura.io/deploy?github_repo=<LINK-TO-GIT-REPO>&hasura_dir=<PATH-TO-HASURA-DIRECTORY-IN-REPO>&branch=<BRANCH-NAME>"
  ><img src="https://hasura.io/deploy-button.svg" alt="Deploy to Hasura Cloud"
/></a>
```

#### URL

```bash
https://cloud.hasura.io/deploy?github_repo=<LINK-TO-GIT-REPO>&hasura_dir=<PATH-TO-HASURA-DIRECTORY-IN-REPO>&branch=<BRANCH-NAME>
```

The `Deploy to Hasura Cloud` button image asset can be found [here](https://hasura.io/deploy-button.svg).

## Step 5: Verify Deployment URL

Once the One Click Deploy URL is generated, verify the link by executing the One Click Deploy workflow as described
[here](index.mdx).

## Troubleshooting your app

If you encounter any errors in the One Click Deploy workflow for you app, you can attempt to troubleshoot them by
manually deploying your Hasura app via the [Hasura CLI](/hasura-cli/pro-cli/installing-uninstalling.mdx).

- Navigate to [Hasura Cloud](https://cloud.hasura.io/) and create a new Hasura Cloud project.

- Connect the required database(s) needed for your app as shown [here](/databases/overview.mdx).

- Set any environment variables required for your app as shown [here](/hasura-cloud/projects/env-vars.mdx).

- Navigate to the project's `hasura` directory in your command prompt:

  ```bash
  cd hasura
  ```

- Verify your Migrations, Metadata and Seeds are in the right format by deploying your app to Hasura Cloud using this
  command:

  ```bash
  hasura deploy --with-seeds --endpoint "<hasura-cloud-project-endpoint>" --admin-secret "<admin-secret>"
  ```

  :::info YOUR ENDPOINT

  Please take note that the endpoint should end with `hasura.app` not `hasura.app/v1/graphql`.

  :::

  This command deploys your Hasura project, including Metadata, Migrations and Seeds. If there is any issue with the
  Metadata, Migrations, or Seed data in your `hasura` directory, it will provide detailed logs to help you resolve it.
