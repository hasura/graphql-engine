# Postgres: Computed fields

## What are computed fields?

Computed fields are virtual values or objects that are dynamically
computed and can be queried along with a table/view's columns. Computed
fields are computed upon request. They are computed by executing
[custom SQL functions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createfunction.html)
(a.k.a. stored procedures) using other columns of the table/view and
other custom inputs if needed.

:::info Note

Computed fields are only exposed over the GraphQL API and the database
schema is not modified on addition of a computed field.

:::

### Supported SQL functions

Only functions which satisfy the following constraints can be added as a
computed field to a table/view. (*terminology from* [Postgres
docs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createfunction.html)):

-   **Function behaviour**: ONLY `STABLE` or `IMMUTABLE`
-   **Argument modes**: ONLY `IN`
-   **Table Argument**: One input argument with a table row type
-   **Return type**: Either `SETOF <table-name>` or `BASE` type

:::info Note

Functions used as computed fields can also accept other arguments other
than the mandatory table row argument. Values for these extra arguments
can be passed as arguments to the computed field in the GraphQL API.

:::

## Computed field types

Based on the SQL function's return type, we can define two types of
computed fields:

### 1. Scalar computed fields

Computed fields whose associated SQL function returns a [base type](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/extend-type-system.html#id-1.8.3.5.9)
like *Integer*, *Boolean*, *Geography* etc. are scalar computed fields.

**Example:**

Let's say we have the following schema:

```plsql
authors(id integer, first_name text, last_name text)
```

[Define an SQL function](/graphql/core/databases/postgres/schema/custom-functions.mdx#pg-create-sql-functions) called
`author_full_name`:

```plsql
CREATE FUNCTION author_full_name(author_row authors)
RETURNS TEXT AS $$
  SELECT author_row.first_name || ' ' || author_row.last_name
$$ LANGUAGE sql STABLE;
```

[Add a computed field](#pg-adding-computed-field) called `full_name` to
the `authors` table using the SQL function above.

Query data from the `authors` table:

<GraphiQLIDE
  query={`query {
  authors {
    id
    first_name
    last_name
    full_name
  }
}`}
response={`{
  "data": {
    "authors": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "first_name": "Chris",
        "last_name": "Raichael",
        "full_name": "Chris Raichael"
      }
    ]
  }
}`}
/>

### 2. Table computed fields

Computed fields whose associated SQL function returns
`SETOF <table-name>` are table computed fields. The return table must be
tracked to define such a computed field.

**Example:**

Let's say we have the following schema:

```plsql
authors(id integer, first_name text, last_name text)

articles(id integer, title text, content text, author_id integer)
```

Now we can define a [table relationship](/graphql/core/databases/postgres/schema/table-relationships/index.mdx) on the
`authors` table to fetch authors along with their articles.

We can make use of computed fields to fetch the author's articles with a
search parameter.

[Define an SQL function](/graphql/core/databases/postgres/schema/custom-functions.mdx#pg-create-sql-functions) called
`filter_author_articles`:

```plsql
CREATE FUNCTION filter_author_articles(author_row authors, search text)
RETURNS SETOF articles AS $$
  SELECT *
  FROM articles
  WHERE
    ( title ilike ('%' || search || '%')
      OR content ilike ('%' || search || '%')
    ) AND author_id = author_row.id
$$ LANGUAGE sql STABLE;
```

[Add a computed field](#pg-adding-computed-field) called
`filtered_articles` to the `authors` table using the SQL function above.

Query data from the `authors` table:

<GraphiQLIDE
  query={`query {
  authors {
    id
    first_name
    last_name
    filtered_articles(args: {search: "Hasura"}){
      id
      title
      content
    }
  }
}`}
response={`{
  "data": {
    "authors": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "first_name": "Chris",
        "last_name": "Raichael",
        "filtered_articles": [
          {
            "id": 1,
            "title": "Computed fields in Hasura",
            "content": "lorem ipsum dolor sit amet"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}`}
/>

## Adding a computed field to a table/view {#pg-adding-computed-field}

<Tabs className="api-tabs">
<TabItem value="console" label="Console">

Head to the `Modify` tab of the table/view and click on the `Add` button
in the `Computed fields` section:

<TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

You can add a computed field in the `tables.yaml` file inside the
`metadata` directory:

```yaml {4-11}
- table:
    schema: public
    name: authors
  computed_fields:
  - name: full_name
    definition:
      function:
        schema: public
        name: author_full_name
      table_argument: null
    comment: ""
```

Apply the metadata by running:

```bash
hasura metadata apply
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="api" label="API">

A computed field can be added to a table/view using the
[pg_add_computed_field](/graphql/core/api-reference/metadata-api/computed-field.mdx#metadata-pg-add-computed-field) metadata API:

```http
POST /v1/metadata HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
X-Hasura-Role: admin

{
  "type": "pg_add_computed_field",
  "args": {
    "source": "<db_name>",
    "table": {
      "name": "authors",
      "schema": "public"
    },
    "name": "full_name",
    "definition": {
      "function": {
        "name": "author_full_name",
        "schema": "public"
      },
      "table_argument": "author_row"
    }
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Computed fields permissions

[Access control](/graphql/core/auth/authorization/index.mdx) to computed fields depends on the type
of computed field.

-   For **scalar computed fields**, permissions are managed similar to
    the [columns permissions](/graphql/core/auth/authorization/permission-rules.mdx#col-level-permissions) of the table.
-   For **table computed fields**, the permissions set on the return
    table are respected.

## Accessing Hasura session variables in computed fields

It can be useful to have access to the session variable from the SQL
function defining a computed field. For instance, suppose we want to
record which users have liked which articles. We can do so using a table
`article_likes` that specifies a many-to-many relationship between
`articles` and `users`. In such a case it can be useful to know if the
current user has liked a specific article, and this information can be
exposed as a *Boolean* computed field on `articles`.

Create a function with an argument for session variables and add it with
the [pg_add_computed_field](/graphql/core/api-reference/metadata-api/computed-field.mdx#metadata-pg-add-computed-field) API with the `session_argument` key
set. The session argument is a JSON object where keys are session
variable names (in lower case) and values are strings. Use the `->>`
JSON operator to fetch the value of a session variable as shown in the
following example.

```plsql
-- 'hasura_session' will be the session argument
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION article_liked_by_user(article_row articles, hasura_session json)
RETURNS boolean AS $$
SELECT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM article_likes A
    WHERE A.user_id = hasura_session ->> 'x-hasura-user-id' AND A.article_id = article_row.id
);
$$ LANGUAGE sql STABLE;
```

```http
POST /v1/metadata HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
X-Hasura-Role: admin

{
    "type":"pg_add_computed_field",
    "args":{
        "source": "<db_name>",
        "table":{
            "name":"articles",
            "schema":"public"
        },
        "name":"liked_by_user",
        "definition":{
            "function":{
                "name":"article_liked_by_user",
                "schema":"public"
            },
            "table_argument":"article_row",
            "session_argument":"hasura_session"
        }
    }
}
```

<GraphiQLIDE
  query={`query {
  articles(where: {id: {_eq: 3}}) {
    id
    liked_by_user
  }
}`}
response={`{
 "data": {
   "articles": [
     {
       "id": "3",
       "liked_by_user": true
     }
   ]
 }
}`}
/>

:::info Note

The specified session argument is not included in the argument options
of the computed field in the GraphQL schema.

## Computed fields vs. Postgres generated columns

Postgres, from version `12`, is introducing [Generated Columns](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/ddl-generated-columns.html).
The value of generated columns is also computed from other columns of a
table. Postgres' generated columns come with their own limitations.
Hasura's computed fields are defined via an SQL function, which allows
users to define any complex business logic in a function. Generated
columns will go together with computed fields where Hasura treats
generated columns as normal Postgres columns.

## Computed fields in Remote relationships

Using computed fields in
[Remote relationships](/graphql/core/databases/postgres/schema/remote-relationships/index.mdx) allows
transformation of data from table columns before joining with data from
remote sources. For instance, suppose we want to extract certain field
from a `json` column and join it with a field in a remote schema by
argument value. We would define a computed field which returns a scalar
type of the field value in the `json` column and use it to join the
graphql field of the remote schema. Consider the following Postgres
schema.

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/graphql/core/databases/postgres/schema/computed-fields-remote-relationship.png"
  width="700px"
/>

```plsql
CREATE TABLE "user" (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL, address json NOT NULL);

-- SQL function returns city of a "user" using "->>" json operator
CREATE FUNCTION get_city(table_row "user")
RETURNS TEXT AS $$
  SELECT table_row.address ->> 'city'
$$ LANGUAGE sql STABLE;
```

Now, let's track the table and add computed field `user_city` using the
SQL function `get_city`. Consider the following remote schema.

```graphql
type Query {
  get_coordinates(city: String): Coordinates
}
type Coordinates{
  lat: Float
  long: Float
}
```

[Define a remote relationship](/graphql/core/api-reference/metadata-api/remote-relationships.mdx#metadata-pg-create-remote-relationship)
with name `user_location` from `user_city` scalar computed field to
`get_coordinates` remote schema field. We can query users with the
pincode of their residing place.

<GraphiQLIDE
  query={`query {
  user {
    id
    name
    user_city
    user_location
  }
}`}
response={`{
  "data": {
    "authors": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Alice",
        "user_city": "Frisco",
        "user_location": {
          "lat": 33.155373,
          "long": -96.818733
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}`}
/>

:::info Note

Only `Scalar computed fields` are allowed to join fields from remote
sources
