## Subscription Execution

For serving subscription requests, Hasura optimizes the subscription execution to ensure it is as fast as possible while
not overloading the database with concurrent queries.

To achieve this, Hasura uses a combination of the following techniques:

- **Grouping same queries into "cohorts" **: Hasura groups subscriptions with the same set of query and session
  variables into a single cohort. The subscribers in a cohort are updated simultaneously.
- **Diff-checking**: On receiving response from the database, Hasura checks the diff between the old and new values and
  sends the response only to the subscribers whose values have changed.
- **Multiplexing**: Hasura groups similar "parameterized" subscriptions together and additionally splits them into
  batches for efficient performance on the database. The batch size can be configured using the
  [`HASURA_GRAPHQL_LIVE_QUERIES_MULTIPLEXED_BATCH_SIZE`](deployment/graphql-engine-flags/reference.mdx#multiplexed-batch-size)
  environment variable. You can read more about multiplexing
  [here](subscriptions/postgres/livequery/execution.mdx#subscription-multiplexing). For example, in the image below, we
  are grouping the three subscriptions into a single multiplexed query.

For more details on how Hasura executes subscriptions, refer to the
[live query](/subscriptions/postgres/livequery/execution.mdx) or
[streaming subscription](/subscriptions/postgres/streaming/index.mdx) documentation.

## Observability

<ProductBadge self />

Hasura EE exposes a set of [Prometheus Metrics](/observability/enterprise-edition/prometheus/metrics.mdx/#subscription-metrics)
that can be used to monitor the subscriptions system and help diagnose performance issues.

:::info More on Observability

To find out more about observability, including best practices, check out
[observability docs section](/observability/overview.mdx).

The following metrics can be used to monitor the performance of subscriptions:

:::

- [`hasura_active_subscriptions`](/observability/enterprise-edition/prometheus/metrics.mdx#active-subscriptions)
- [`hasura_active_subscription_pollers`](/observability/enterprise-edition/prometheus/metrics.mdx#active-subscription-pollers)
- [`hasura_active_subscription_pollers_in_error_state`](/observability/enterprise-edition/prometheus/metrics.mdx#active-subscription-pollers-in-error-state)
- [`hasura_subscription_db_execution_time_seconds`](/observability/enterprise-edition/prometheus/metrics.mdx#subscription-database-execution-time)
- [`hasura_subscription_total_time_seconds`](/observability/enterprise-edition/prometheus/metrics.mdx#subscription-total-time)

## Golden Signals for subscriptions

You can perform
[Golden Signals-based](https://sre.google/sre-book/monitoring-distributed-systems/#xref_monitoring_golden-signals)
system monitoring with Hasura's exported metrics. The following are the golden signals for subscriptions:

### Latency

The latency of a subscription is defined as the time taken to complete one fetch cycle for the subscription. To monitor
latency, you can monitor the [`hasura_subscription_total_time_seconds`](#subscription-total-time) metric.

If the value of this metric is high, then it may be an indication that the multiplexed query is taking longer to execute
in the database, verify this with
[`hasura_subscription_db_execution_time_seconds`](#subscription-database-execution-time) metric. If the value of this
metric is high as well, you can do the following:

- Check if any database index can help improve the performance of the query, [analyzing the GraphQL query](#analyze)
  will show the generated multiplexed query.
- Avoid querying unnecessary fields that translate to joins or function calls in the GraphQL query.
- Consider adding more read replicas to the database and running subscriptions on them.

### Traffic

The traffic of a subscription is defined as the number of subscriptions that are active at any given point of time. To
monitor traffic, you can monitor the [`hasura_active_subscriptions`](#active-subscriptions) metric.

If the value of this metric is high (and above your established baseline), then you may want to consider increasing the
number of Hasura instances to handle the load.

### Errors

Errors in subscriptions can be monitored using the following metrics

- [`hasura_graphql_requests_total{type="subscription",response_status="error"}`](/observability/enterprise-edition/prometheus/metrics.mdx#hasura-graphql-requests-total):
  Total number of errors that happen before the subscription is started (i.e. validation, parsing and authorization
  errors).
- [`hasura_active_subscription_pollers_in_error_state`](#active-subscription-pollers-in-error-state): Number of
  subscription pollers that are in error state.

If the value of the [`hasura_active_subscription_pollers_in_error_state`](#active-subscription-pollers-in-error-state)
is non-zero, you should consider investigating the `livequery-poller-log` logs (this will include the error message) to
debug the failing subscription.

### Saturation

Saturation is the threshold until which the subscriptions can run smoothly; once this threshold is crossed, you may see
performance issues, and abrupt disconnections of the connected subscribers.

To monitor the saturation for subscriptions, you can monitor the following:

- CPU and memory usage of Hasura instances.
- For postgres backends, you can monitor the
  [`hasura_postgres_connections`](/observability/enterprise-edition/prometheus/metrics.mdx#hasura-postgres-connections) metric to see the
  number of connections opened by Hasura with the database.
- P99 of the [`hasura_subscription_total_time_seconds`](#subscription-total-time) metric.

If the number of database connections is high, you can consider increasing the `max_connections` of the database.

You can also consider scaling the Hasura instances horizontally and vertically to handle the load.

## Tuning subscription performance

Hasura GraphQL Engine is designed to scale to handle millions of concurrent subscriptions. However, due to
misconfigurations or inefficient queries, the performance of subscriptions can be impacted. This section describes how
to analyze and tune the performance of subscriptions.

### Analyze

Using the `Analyze` button on GraphiQL API Explorer of the Hasura Console, you can see the generated multiplexed SQL and
its query plan. The query plan can reveal the bottlenecks in query execution and appropriate indexes can be added to
improve performance.

In addition to these, simplifying the subscription to avoid unnecessary joins or avoiding fetching fields which are not
going to change can also help improve performance.

### Performance tuning

The parameters governing the performance of subscriptions in terms of throughput, latency and resource utilization are:

- `HASURA_GRAPHQL_LIVE_QUERIES_MULTIPLEXED_REFETCH_INTERVAL`
  - Time interval between Hasura multiplexed queries to the DB for fetching changes in subscriptions data, default = 1
    sec
  - Increasing this reduces the frequency of queries to the DB, thereby reducing its load and improving throughput while
    increasing the latency of updates to the clients.
- `HASURA_GRAPHQL_LIVE_QUERIES_MULTIPLEXED_BATCH_SIZE`
  - Number of similar subscriptions batched into a single SQL query to the DB, default = 100
  - Increasing this reduces the number of SQL statements fired to the DB, thereby reducing its load and improving
    throughput while increasing individual SQL execution times and latency.
  - You should reduce this value if the execution time of the SQL generated by Hasura after multiplexing is more than
    the refetch interval.
- `max_connections` of the source
  - Max number of connections Hasura opens with the DB, default = 50 (configurable via
    [update source metadata API](api-reference/metadata-api/source.mdx))
  - Increasing this increases the number of connections Hasura can open with the DB to execute queries, thereby
    improving concurrency **but adding load to the database**. A very high number of concurrent connections can result
    in poor DB performance.

:::info Note

The default values offer a reasonable trade-off between resource utilization and performance for most use cases. For
scenarios with heavy queries and a high number of active subscriptions, you need to benchmark the setup and these
parameters need to be iterated upon to achieve optimal performance.
