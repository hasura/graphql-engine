# Links

#### Internal links

When linking to other docs pages, use _root relative file paths_ (`/schema/postgres/tables.mdx`) rather than _relative
links_ (`../../path/to/file.mdx`) in order to avoid broken links. Why? when files are moved around, we just need to
replace old path with new path - no relative `../../../` resolution required.

Please read the [Links](/docusaurus-mdx-guide/links.mdx) section for more details on how to work with Links.

An example:

```
[Postgres tables](/schema/postgres/tables.mdx)
```

In this example, `Postgres tables` is the link text, and `/schema/postgres/tables.mdx` is the file path which will be
resolved as link by docusaurus.

#### External links

External links are no different in syntax, replace the file paths with external links and that's it.

An example:

`[Google](https://www.google.com/)` [Google](https://www.google.com/)


:::info Note

If you link to an external resource, make sure to link to the most current version of the same, e.g.
`https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/intro-whatis.html` rather than
`https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/intro-whatis.html`.
