# Transfer existing Hasura Cloud project to a new project

## Introduction

To transfer a project you will have to create a new Hasura project and
configure it with the same Hasura metadata and other configuration as in
the previous project.

The following is a guide to achieve this.

## Step 1: Export metadata from existing project

See [exporting metadata](/graphql/core/migrations/manage-metadata.mdx) to get a copy of the
current Hasura metadata on your project.

Do ensure no further changes are made to the Hasura metadata post this.

## Step 2: Create a new Cloud project with the same configuration

See `Step 1` of [creating projects](/graphql/cloud/projects/create.mdx) to create a new
Hasura Cloud project.

After project creation, update the Hasura Cloud configuration of the new
project with the same configuration as the earlier project. i.e. add the
same ENV vars, custom domains, collaborators, billing, etc.

## Step 3: Apply the exported metadata to the new project

See [applying metadata](/graphql/core/migrations/manage-metadata.mdx) to apply the earlier
exported metadata to the new project.

The new project should now be generating the same GraphQL API as the
earlier project.

## Step 4: Delete the earlier project

See [deleting projects](/graphql/cloud/projects/delete.mdx) to delete the earlier project.

## Optional steps

-  If you are using Hasura migrations on your project, please mark all
    existing migrations as applied on the new project using the
    following Hasura CLI command:

    ```bash
    hasura migrate apply --skip-execution --endpoint <new-project-endpoint> --admin-secret <new-project-admin-secret> --all-databases
    ```

-  You can [rename](/graphql/cloud/projects/details.mdx#rename-project) your new project to the same name
    as the earlier project if you wish.

-  If you haven't renamed your new project or set up a
    [custom domain](/graphql/cloud/projects/domains.mdx) for your project, you might
    want to update any clients consuming the GraphQL API to point to the
    new project's GraphQL endpoint.

## Zero-downtime transfer

To achieve a zero-downtime transfer, you will need to have a
[custom domain](/graphql/cloud/projects/domains.mdx) attached to your Cloud project.
Once the new project is set up identically as the old one, you can
update the DNS entries for your custom domain to the new project to have
a seamless transfer of traffic to the new project.

If you simply want to avoid updating your clients with the new project's
API endpoint, you can simply [rename](/graphql/cloud/projects/details.mdx#rename-project) your new project
with the same name as the earlier project. This will cause a short
downtime of your API after you delete your old project until you rename
the new one.

## Caveats

You will lose the following data from your earlier project in the
process:

-  all existing scheduled events
-  all existing async actions
-  past invocation logs of cron triggers

If you would like these to be transferred to the new project as well
please get in touch with support regarding this before deleting the old
project.
