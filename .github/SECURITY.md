## Reporting Vulnerabilities

Weâ€™re extremely grateful for security researchers and users that report vulnerabilities to the Hasura GraphQL Community. All reports are thoroughly investigated by a set of community volunteers.

To make a report, please email us at [build@hasura.io](mailto:build@hasura.io) with the complete security details attaching all necessary information.

### When Should I Report a Vulnerability?

- You think you discovered a potential security vulnerability in the Hasura GraphQL Engine or related components.
- You are unsure how a vulnerability affects the Hasura GraphQL Engine.
- You think you discovered a vulnerability in another project that Hasura GraphQL Engine depends on (e.g. heroku, docker, etc)
- Any other risk that would harm the Hasura GraphQL Engine.

### When Should I NOT Report a Vulnerability?

- You need help tuning Hasura GraphQL Engine components for security.
- You need help applying security related updates.
- Your issue is not security related.

## Security Vulnerability Response

Each report is acknowledged and analyzed by Product Security Team members within 3 working days. 

As the security issue moves from triage, to identified fix, to release planning we will keep the reporter updated.

## Public Disclosure Timing

A public disclosure date is negotiated by the Hasura GraphQL product security team and the bug submitter. We prefer to fully disclose the bug as soon as possible once a user mitigation is available. It is reasonable to delay disclosure when the bug or the fix is not yet fully understood, the solution is not well-tested, or for vendor coordination. The timeframe for disclosure is from immediate (especially if it's already publicly known) to a few weeks. As a basic default, we expect report date to disclosure date to be on the order of 7 days. The Hasura GraphQL product security team holds the final say when setting a disclosure date.
