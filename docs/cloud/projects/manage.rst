Invitations are sent via email with a link to accept the invitation. Clicking the link brings them to the Hasura Cloud login page. If they donâ€™t already have an account, they can sign-up to create a new account. 

.. admonition:: Invitation email must match account email

  If a new account is created, make sure the invitation email matches to the account email.

Invitations can be accepted or declined via the Invitations tab of your Hasura Cloud Settings:
