# Custom Docker images or binaries for Hasura GraphQL engine

If you need a binary for Hasura GraphQL engine to run in a non-Docker
environment or you require custom Docker images, we can make them
available via a support plan. A possible use case could be that the
default base image *(alpine)* is not compatible with your security
scanning tool ([Anchore](https://anchore.com/), [Sysdig Secure](https://sysdig.com/products/kubernetes-security/image-scanning/),
etc.).

To set up such a support plan, please contact us using the form on our
[contact page](https://hasura.io/contact-us/) and make sure to include
the Linux flavor (*CentOS, Debian slim, etc.*) or the target
architecture for the binary you'd be interested in.

A custom image will be made available for every stable release of
GraphQL engine.
