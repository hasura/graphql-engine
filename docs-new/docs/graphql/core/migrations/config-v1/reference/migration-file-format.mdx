# Migration file format reference (config v1)

## Migration filename format

Each migration file has the following format:

```bash
<version>_<name>.{up|down}.{sql|yaml}
```

A `version` which is the Unix timestamp in nanoseconds when the file was
created is the first part. Followed by a `name` which is either manually
added or auto-generated by the console. The next part indicates what
step this is. If it is `up`, it means that this is the forward step, for
e.g. creating a relationship or a table. The `down` indicates that it is
the corresponding rollback step. The last part denotes the file format -
whether it is an SQL file or a YAML file.

## YAML files

Each `up` or `down` YAML file contains Hasura metadata API actions to be
executed for that particular migration. The file should have a list of
such API actions, which is represented with a `-` in YAML. Here is an
example file:

**1551151778747_create_table_public_author.up.yaml**

```yaml
- type: run_sql
  args:
    sql: |
      CREATE TABLE "public"."author" (
        "id" SERIAL NOT NULL,
        "name" TEXT NOT NULL,
        PRIMARY KEY ("id")
      );
- type: track_table
  args:
    schema: public
    name: author
```

**1551151778747_create_table_public_author.down.yaml**

```yaml
- type: untrack_table
  args:
    schema: public
    name: author
- type: run_sql
  args:
    sql: |
      DROP TABLE "public"."author"
```

Each one of the actions in these files are actually Hasura metadata API
calls, which are executed in **sequence** when the migration is applied.
You can find all the metadata actions that are available in the
[metadata API reference](/graphql/core/api-reference/metadata-api/index.mdx#metadata-query).

## SQL Files

:::info Note

The files are there just for the user's convenience, since the SQL can
already be included in the YAML files.

:::

As the name indicates, an SQL file can contain SQL statements which are
executed on the apply step of the migration. There can be an `up` SQL
and a `down` SQL file. The SQL file is executed first if it is present
in an up migration and the YAML file is executed first in a down
migration.
