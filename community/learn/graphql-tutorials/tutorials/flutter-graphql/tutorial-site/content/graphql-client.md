graphql_flutter plugin gives a neat abstraction layer and an interface to your GraphQL server. You don't need to worry about constructing your queries with request body, headers and options, that you might have done with `http` or `dio` say. You can directly write queries and mutations in GraphQL and they will automatically be sent to your server via your client instance.
