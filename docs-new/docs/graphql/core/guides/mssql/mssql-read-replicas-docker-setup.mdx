# MS SQL Server Read Replicas - Docker Setup

## Introduction

The following tutorial helps setting up a Docker container setup for the
MS SQL Server Read Replicas.

This tutorial was highly influenced by [this blog](https://dbtut.com/index.php/2020/06/09/sql-server-2019-alwayson-availability-group-on-docker-containers)

## Step 1: Set up the Docker image with SQL Server

### Create Docker file

```docker
FROM ubuntu:18.04
ARG DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive

RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install apt-utils -y

RUN apt-get install sudo wget curl gnupg gnupg1 gnupg2 -y
RUN apt-get install software-properties-common systemd vim -y
RUN wget -qO- https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | sudo apt-key add -

RUN add-apt-repository "$(wget -qO- https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/18.04/mssql-server-2019.list)"
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y mssql-server

RUN /opt/mssql/bin/mssql-conf set hadr.hadrenabled  1
RUN /opt/mssql/bin/mssql-conf set sqlagent.enabled true

EXPOSE 1433

ENTRYPOINT /opt/mssql/bin/sqlservr
```

### Build Docker image

```bash
docker build -t sqlag:ha .
```

## Step 2: Create the Docker configuration file with 3 SQL nodes

Create three nodes:

-   **sqlNode1**: Primary server
-   **sqlNode2** and **sqlNode3**: Secondary Servers

```yaml
services:
  db1:
     container_name: sqlNode1
     image: sqlag:ha
     hostname: sqlNode1
     domainname: lab.local
     environment:
        SA_PASSWORD: "Password1"
        ACCEPT_EULA: "Y"
     ports:
     - "1501:1433"
     extra_hosts:
        sqlNode2.labl.local: "172.16.238.22"
        sqlNode3.labl.local: "172.16.238.23"
     networks:
        internal:
                 ipv4_address: 172.16.238.21

  db2:
     container_name: sqlNode2
     image: sqlag:ha
     hostname: sqlNode2
     domainname: lab.local
     environment:
        SA_PASSWORD: "Password1"
        ACCEPT_EULA: "Y"
     ports:
     - "1502:1433"
     extra_hosts:
        sqlNode1.lab.local: "172.16.238.21"
        sqlNode3.lab.local: "172.16.238.23"
     networks:
        internal:
                 ipv4_address: 172.16.238.22

  db3:
     container_name: sqlNode3
     image: sqlag:ha
     hostname: sqlNode3
     domainname: lab.local
     environment:
        SA_PASSWORD: "Password1"
        ACCEPT_EULA: "Y"
     ports:
     - "1503:1433"
     extra_hosts:
        sqlNode1.lab.local: "172.16.238.21"
        sqlNode2.lab.local: "172.16.238.22"
     networks:
        internal:
                 ipv4_address: 172.16.238.23

networks:
internal:
  ipam:
        driver: default
        config:
            - subnet: 172.16.238.0/24
```

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## Step 3: Figure the IP address of the gateway to connect

```bash
$> ifconfig

br-7d762e376414: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
     inet 172.16.238.1  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 172.16.238.255
     inet6 fe80::42:b0ff:fe8b:57ef  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x20<link>
     ether 02:42:b0:8b:57:ef  txqueuelen 0  (Ethernet)
     RX packets 20022  bytes 2157399 (2.1 MB)
     RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0
     TX packets 36571  bytes 8365375 (8.3 MB)
     TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0
```

From above, you can notice that the docker gateway is `172.16.238.1`,
Once the docker container is up, we can connect to the sql server via
`172.16.238.1` and `1501`, `1502` and `1503` ports.

Test it out by trying to connect to any one of the node:

```bash
$> sqlcmd -S 172.16.238.1,1501 -U SA -P "Password1"
```

```sql
1> SELECT name FROM master.dbo.sysdatabases;
2> GO
```

## Step 4: Create certificates

Follow the steps to create certificates on the nodes:

1.  Create certificate for primary node, store it in a temp location in
    the node
2.  Copy the certificate from the primary node to local system
3.  Copy the certificate from local system to secondary nodes
4.  Apply the certificate on secondary nodes

```sql
USE master
GO

CREATE LOGIN dbm_login WITH PASSWORD = 'Password1';
CREATE USER dbm_user FOR LOGIN dbm_login;
GO

CREATE MASTER KEY ENCRYPTION BY PASSWORD = 'Password1';
go
CREATE CERTIFICATE dbm_certificate WITH SUBJECT = 'dbm';
BACKUP CERTIFICATE dbm_certificate
TO FILE = '/tmp/dbm_certificate.cer'
WITH PRIVATE KEY (
      FILE = '/tmp/dbm_certificate.pvk',
      ENCRYPTION BY PASSWORD = 'Password1'
   );
GO
```

Store the above sql file in `1-primary-setup-certificate.sql`. Then apply the
transaction to primary node via the following.

```bash
sqlcmd -S 172.16.238.1,1501 -U SA -P "Password1" -i 1-primary-setup-certificate.sql
```

Please note that for the rest of the setup, it would be easier if we do
the following: 1. Create a sql file with the transaction 2. Run the
transaction via sqlcmd

Now, let's copy the certificate from primary and paste them into the
secondary nodes.

```bash
docker cp sqlNode1:/tmp/dbm_certificate.cer .
docker cp sqlNode1:/tmp/dbm_certificate.pvk .
docker cp dbm_certificate.cer sqlNode2:/tmp/
docker cp dbm_certificate.pvk sqlNode2:/tmp/
docker cp dbm_certificate.cer sqlNode3:/tmp/
docker cp dbm_certificate.pvk sqlNode3:/tmp/
```

Connect to all the secondary nodes and execute the following SQL:

```sql
CREATE LOGIN dbm_login WITH PASSWORD = 'Password1';
CREATE USER dbm_user FOR LOGIN dbm_login;
GO

CREATE MASTER KEY ENCRYPTION BY PASSWORD = 'Password1';
-- ALTER MASTER KEY REGENERATE WITH ENCRYPTION BY PASSWORD = 'Password1';
GO
CREATE CERTIFICATE dbm_certificate
   AUTHORIZATION dbm_user
   FROM FILE = '/tmp/dbm_certificate.cer'
   WITH PRIVATE KEY (
   FILE = '/tmp/dbm_certificate.pvk',
   DECRYPTION BY PASSWORD = 'Password1'
);
```

## Step 5: Create the endpoint for Always On and setup health monitoring for the server

Execute the following SQL first on primary node and then on the
secondary nodes.

```sql
CREATE ENDPOINT [Hadr_endpoint]
   AS TCP (LISTENER_IP = (0.0.0.0), LISTENER_PORT = 5022)
   FOR DATA_MIRRORING (
      ROLE = ALL,
      AUTHENTICATION = CERTIFICATE dbm_certificate,
      ENCRYPTION = REQUIRED ALGORITHM AES
      );
ALTER ENDPOINT [Hadr_endpoint] STATE = STARTED;
GRANT CONNECT ON ENDPOINT::[Hadr_endpoint] TO [dbm_login];
```

To enable the health monitoring, execute the SQL on all nodes:

```sql
ALTER EVENT SESSION  AlwaysOn_health ON SERVER WITH (STARTUP_STATE=ON);
GO
```

## Step 6: Create Always on Availability Group

Execute the following SQL on primary node.

```sql
CREATE AVAILABILITY GROUP [AG1]
      WITH (CLUSTER_TYPE = NONE)
      FOR REPLICA ON
      N'sqlNode1'
            WITH (
            ENDPOINT_URL = N'tcp://sqlNode1:5022',
            AVAILABILITY_MODE = ASYNCHRONOUS_COMMIT,
               SEEDING_MODE = AUTOMATIC,
               FAILOVER_MODE = MANUAL,
            SECONDARY_ROLE (ALLOW_CONNECTIONS = ALL)
               ),
      N'sqlNode2'
            WITH (
            ENDPOINT_URL = N'tcp://sqlNode2:5022',
            AVAILABILITY_MODE = ASYNCHRONOUS_COMMIT,
               SEEDING_MODE = AUTOMATIC,
               FAILOVER_MODE = MANUAL,
            SECONDARY_ROLE (ALLOW_CONNECTIONS = ALL)
               ),
      N'sqlNode3'
            WITH (
            ENDPOINT_URL = N'tcp://sqlNode3:5022',
            AVAILABILITY_MODE = ASYNCHRONOUS_COMMIT,
               SEEDING_MODE = AUTOMATIC,
               FAILOVER_MODE = MANUAL,
            SECONDARY_ROLE (ALLOW_CONNECTIONS = ALL)
               );
GO

ALTER AVAILABILITY GROUP [ag1] GRANT CREATE ANY DATABASE;
GO
```

## Step 7: Join the secondary nodes to Availability Group (AG)

Execute the following SQL only on secondary nodes.

```sql
ALTER AVAILABILITY GROUP [ag1] JOIN WITH (CLUSTER_TYPE = NONE);
ALTER AVAILABILITY GROUP [ag1] GRANT CREATE ANY DATABASE;
GO
```

## Step 8: Setting up the primary node with some values and database

In this step, we'll create a database on primary and add some data to it
and verify that the replication happens on secondary nodes successfully.

Execute the following SQL on primary node.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE agtestdb;
GO
ALTER DATABASE agtestdb SET RECOVERY FULL;
GO
BACKUP DATABASE agtestdb TO DISK = '/var/opt/mssql/data/agtestdb.bak';
GO

ALTER AVAILABILITY GROUP [ag1] ADD DATABASE [agtestdb];
GO

USE agtestdb;
GO

CREATE TABLE inventory (id INT, name NVARCHAR(50), quantity INT);
GO
INSERT INTO inventory VALUES (1, 'banana', 150); INSERT INTO Inventory VALUES (2, 'orange', 154);
GO
```

Connect to secondary replica and see the database and values. Test if
the database has been replicated on secondary nodes

```bash
âžœ sqlcmd -S 172.16.238.1,1502 -U SA -P "Password1"
1> SELECT name FROM master.dbo.sysdatabases;
2> GO
```

## Step 9: Setup Routing List URL

In this step, we'll do the following:

1.  Change the secondary replicas to allow read only connections
2.  Create read only routing url for each nodes
3.  Create the routing list

Note that, the read only routing URL should be such that you are able to
connect from outside the container, so it's better to provide the actual
IP of the node.

Execute the following SQL on primary node.

```sql
ALTER AVAILABILITY GROUP [AG1]
MODIFY REPLICA ON
N'sqlNode1' WITH
   (SECONDARY_ROLE (ALLOW_CONNECTIONS = READ_ONLY));

ALTER AVAILABILITY GROUP [AG1]
MODIFY REPLICA ON
N'sqlNode1' WITH
   (SECONDARY_ROLE (READ_ONLY_ROUTING_URL = N'tcp://172.16.238.21:1433'));


ALTER AVAILABILITY GROUP [AG1]
MODIFY REPLICA ON
N'sqlNode2' WITH  
   (SECONDARY_ROLE (ALLOW_CONNECTIONS = READ_ONLY));

ALTER AVAILABILITY GROUP [AG1]
MODIFY REPLICA ON
N'sqlNode2' WITH  
   (SECONDARY_ROLE (READ_ONLY_ROUTING_URL = N'tcp://172.16.238.22:1433'));


ALTER AVAILABILITY GROUP [AG1]
MODIFY REPLICA ON
N'sqlNode3' WITH
      (SECONDARY_ROLE (ALLOW_CONNECTIONS = READ_ONLY));

ALTER AVAILABILITY GROUP [AG1]
MODIFY REPLICA ON
N'sqlNode3' WITH
      (SECONDARY_ROLE (READ_ONLY_ROUTING_URL = N'tcp://172.16.238.23:1433'));


ALTER AVAILABILITY GROUP [AG1]
MODIFY REPLICA ON  
N'sqlNode1' WITH
   (PRIMARY_ROLE (READ_ONLY_ROUTING_LIST=(('sqlNode3','sqlNode2'),'sqlnode1')));

ALTER AVAILABILITY GROUP [AG1]
MODIFY REPLICA ON
N'sqlNode2' WITH  
   (PRIMARY_ROLE (READ_ONLY_ROUTING_LIST=(('sqlNode1','sqlNode3'),'sqlnode2')));

ALTER AVAILABILITY GROUP [AG1]
MODIFY REPLICA ON
N'sqlNode3' WITH
      (PRIMARY_ROLE (READ_ONLY_ROUTING_LIST=(('sqlNode1','sqlNode2'),'sqlnode3')));

GO
```

## Step 10: Create the listener URL

This listener URL is used to route the Read only request to one of the
Read only secondary replicas

Execute the following SQL on primary node.

```sql
ALTER AVAILABILITY GROUP [AG1] REMOVE LISTENER 'AGListener';
GO

ALTER AVAILABILITY GROUP [AG1]
      ADD LISTENER 'AGListener' ( WITH IP ( (N'172.16.238.21', N'255.255.255.0') ) , PORT = 1434 );
GO
```

Let's go ahead and test, if we could connect to our secondary replicas
using the listener URL. Note that, since we marked read replicas as
`ReadOnly`, we will only be able to connect to secondary nodes only when
we provide the ApplicationIntent as `ReadOnly`

Let's first connect to out primary replica

```sql
sqlcmd -S 172.16.238.21,1434 -U SA  -d agtestdb -P "Password1"
```

Now let's connect to secondary replicas using ReadIntent Only

```sql
sqlcmd -S 172.16.238.21,1434 -U SA  -d agtestdb -P "Password1" -K ReadOnly
```
