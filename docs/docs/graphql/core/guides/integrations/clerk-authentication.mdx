# Clerk Authentication Using JWTs with Hasura GraphQL Engine

## Introduction

This guide explains how to connect Hasura GraphQL Engine with [Clerk](https://clerk.dev), an authentication provider built for the modern web.

Clerk authenticates users, manages session tokens, and provides user management functionality. The Clerk integration with Hasura enables you to authenticate requests to your Hasura GraphQL API using a JSON Web Token (JWT).

## Assumptions

This guide assumes the following: 
- You have [Hasura Cloud account](https://cloud.hasura.io/) and project already set up.
- You have created a [Clerk account](https://dashboard.clerk.dev/sign-up).

## Step 1: Create a Clerk application

- Navigate to your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.dev) and click on the `+ Add application` button.
- Give your application a name. Then choose whichever authentication strategy and social login providers you prefer. For more information, check out Clerk's [application setup guide](https://clerk.dev/docs/how-to/set-up-your-application).

## Step 2: Create Hasura JWT template

Once your Clerk application has been created, navigate to **JWT Templates**. Click the `+ New template` button and choose the Hasura template.

/>

This will pre-populate the default claims required to authenticate requests to Hasura. You can read more about the necessary claims [here](/docs/latest/graphql/core/auth/authentication/jwt/#the-spec).

You can include additional claims or modify them as necessary. [Shortcodes](https://clerk.dev/docs/how-to/jwt-templates#shortcodes) are available to make adding dynamic user values easy.

  alt="Hasura JWT template claims"
  width="750"
/>

By default, Clerk will sign the JWT with a private key automatically generated for your application, which is what most developers use for Hasura. If you choose this, you can customize this key.

## Step 3: Provide JWT key to Hasura

The next step is to provide Hasura with the public key used to verify the JWT issued by Clerk. Assuming you didn't use a custom key, this can be done with the JSON Web Key Set (JWKS), which Clerk automatically creates an endpoint for with your frontend API.

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/graphql/core/guides/clerk-04_jwks-endpoint.png"
  alt="JWKS endpoint"
/>

Copy the JWKS endpoint. Go to your Hasura project settings and add a new environment variable. Set the key to `HASURA_GRAPHQL_JWT_SECRET` and the value to the following:

```
{"jwk_url":"https://<YOUR_FRONTEND_API>/.well-known/jwks.json"}
```

Replace the whole URL with the endpoint you copied or `<YOUR_FRONTEND_API>` with your frontend API.


:::info Note

If you did use a custom signing key, instead of providing the `jwk_url`, you need to provide the algorithm **type** (ex. HS256) and **key** as the value of `HASURA_GRAPHQL_JWT_SECRET`:

```
{"type": "HS256", "key": "<YOUR_SIGNING_KEY>"}
```

:::


## Step 4: Install the Clerk library

Now it's time to add the Clerk library to your application.

Depending on the frontend library or framework you're using, Clerk has different packages for accessing the Clerk JavaScript SDK. For example, there is a package for [Next.js](https://github.com/clerkinc/javascript/tree/main/packages/nextjs), [React](https://github.com/clerkinc/javascript/tree/main/packages/react), [Remix](https://github.com/clerkinc/javascript/tree/main/packages/remix), and [more](https://github.com/clerkinc/javascript/tree/main/packages). 

Using a Next.js application as an example, run the following:

```bash
npm install @clerk/nextjs
```

Once you have the appropriate package installed, set the following environment variables (typically in a `.env.local` file in the project root directory):

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_HASURA_GRAPHQL_API=<YOUR_HASURA_ENDPOINT>
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_FRONTEND_API=<YOUR_CLERK_FRONTEND_API>
CLERK_API_KEY=<YOUR_CLERK_API_KEY>
```

:::info Note

The `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix is specific to Next.js applications, but there are similiar conventions for other frameworks to pass build-time values to the client.

:::

After the environment variables are set, you can start up your dev server.

The component you want to make authenticated requests from needs to be a child of both `<ClerkProvider />` and `<SignedIn />`. 

In Next.js, update `pages/_app.js` with the following:

```jsx
import {
  ClerkProvider,
  RedirectToSignIn,
  SignedIn,
  SignedOut
} from '@clerk/nextjs';

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <ClerkProvider>
      <>
        <SignedIn>
          <Component {...pageProps} />
        </SignedIn>
        <SignedOut>
          <RedirectToSignIn />
        </SignedOut>
      </>
    </ClerkProvider>
  );
}

export default MyApp;
```

After signing in, the child routes will now be able to make authenticated GraphQL queries to Hasura.

## Step 5: Configure your GraphQL client

GraphQL clients (such as [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/) and [Relay](https://relay.dev/)) can help with querying and caching your data. They can also manage UI state, keep data in sync, and boost performance. That said, you can make a GraphQL request to the Hasura backend with the native browser [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API).

The last step of integrating Clerk as the modern web authentication solution for Hasura is to pass the JWT in the `Authorization` header of your requests. 

You can access the token generated with the Hasura claims by calling `getToken({ template: <your-template-name> })` with the name of your template.

The `getToken` function is made available with the `useAuth()` hook or from the Clerk-provided session object.

:::info Note

The `getToken({ template: <your-template-name> })` call is asynchronous and returns a promise that needs to be resolved before accessing the token value.

:::

The token returned is short-lived for better security and should be called before every request to your GraphQL API. The caching and refreshing of the token is handled automatically by Clerk.

Even if you don't have a database table set up yet, the [GraphQL built-in introspection system](https://graphql.org/learn/introspection/) offers a way to validate that authenticated requests are working properly.

Here is an example of using `Fetch` to make an introspection query in a Next.js application:

```jsx
import { useAuth } from '@clerk/nextjs';

export default function Home() {
  const { getToken } = useAuth();
  const endpoint = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_HASURA_GRAPHQL_API;
  const query = `query { __typename }`;
  const makeQuery = async () => {
    try {
      const response = await fetch(endpoint, {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
          'Content-Type': 'application/json',
          Authorization: `Bearer ${await getToken({ template: 'hasura' })}`
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({ query })
      });
      const data = await response.json();

      // Do something with your data
      console.log(data);
    } catch (err) {
      // Handle errors
    }
  };

  return (
    <button type="button" onClick={makeQuery}>
      Make query
    </button>
  );
}
```

Upon clicking the button, a request is made with our Hasura JWT as the Bearer token in the `Authorization` header. The response is converted to JSON and logged to the browser console.

If all has been successful, you should see something similiar as below in your browser console:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "__typename": "query_root"
  }
}
```
