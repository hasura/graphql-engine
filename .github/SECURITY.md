## Report a Vulnerability

Weâ€™re extremely grateful for security researchers and users that report vulnerabilities to the Hasura GraphQL Community. All reports are thoroughly investigated by a set of community volunteers.

To make a report, please email us at build@hasura.io with the security details.

### When Should I Report a Vulnerability?

- You think you discovered a potential security vulnerability in the Hasura GraphQL Engine or related components
- You are unsure how a vulnerability affects the Hasura GraphQL Engine
- You think you discovered a vulnerability in another project that Hasura GraphQL Engine depends on (e.g. heroku, docker, etc)

### When Should I NOT Report a Vulnerability?

- You need help tuning Hasura GraphQL Engine components for security
- You need help applying security related updates
- Your issue is not security related

## Security Vulnerability Response

Each report is acknowledged and analyzed by Product Security Team members within 3 working days. 
<!-- This will set off the [Security Release Process](https://git.k8s.io/sig-release/security-release-process-documentation/security-release-process.md#disclosures).
Any vulnerability information shared with Product Security Team stays within Kubernetes project and will not be disseminated to other projects unless it is necessary to get the issue fixed. -->

As the security issue moves from triage, to identified fix, to release planning we will keep the reporter updated.

## Public Disclosure Timing

A public disclosure date is negotiated by the Hasura GraphQL product security team and the bug submitter. We prefer to fully disclose the bug as soon as possible once a user mitigation is available. It is reasonable to delay disclosure when the bug or the fix is not yet fully understood, the solution is not well-tested, or for vendor coordination. The timeframe for disclosure is from immediate (especially if it's already publicly known) to a few weeks. As a basic default, we expect report date to disclosure date to be on the order of 7 days. The Hasura GraphQL product security team holds the final say when setting a disclosure date.
