# Connecting databases to Hasura GraphQL engine

## Introduction

From `v2.0.0` onwards Hasura GraphQL engine allows connecting to
multiple databases and build a unified GraphQL API based on the database
schemas.

## Connect a database {#connect-database-v2-0}

In versions `v2.0.0` and above, databases can be connected and removed
dynamically without having to restart the GraphQL engine instance via
the console / metadata APIs / CLI:

<Tabs className="api-tabs">
<TabItem value="console" label="Console">

Head to `Data -> Manage -> Connect database`

  alt="Connect default database"
  width="1000px"
/>

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

In your `config v3` project, head to the
`/metadata/databases/databases.yaml` file and add the database
configuration as below:

```yaml
- name: <db_name>
  configuration:
    connection_info:
      database_url:
        from_env: <DB_URL_ENV_VAR>
      pool_settings:
        idle_timeout: 180
        max_connections: 50
        retries: 1
    tables: []
    functions: []
```

Apply the metadata by running:

```bash
hasura metadata apply
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="api" label="API">

Depending on the type of database, you can add a database using the
[sources metadata API](/graphql/core/api-reference/metadata-api/source.mdx).

For example:

```http
POST /v1/metadata HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
X-Hasura-Role: admin

{
  "type": "pg_add_source",
  "args": {
    "name": "<db_name>",
    "configuration": {
      "connection_info": {
        "database_url": {
          "from_env": "<DB_URL_ENV_VAR>"
        },
        "pool_settings": {
          "retries": 1,
          "idle_timeout": 180,
          "max_connections": 50
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info Note

- You can connect to databases either using env vars or by using their
  raw connection string/parameters. It is recommended to use env vars
  for better security _(as connection details are part of Hasura
  metadata)_ as well as to allow configuring different databases in
  different environments _(like staging/production)_ easily.
- A Postgres database can be connected using the
  `HASURA_GRAPHQL_DATABASE_URL` env var as well in which case it gets
  added automatically as a database named `default`

:::info Create a new Postgres DB inside Hasura Cloud

For a quick start with Hasura, you can also create a Postgres database
with Heroku from inside of Hasura Cloud. For more information, see
[Connect new/existing database on Hasura Cloud](/graphql/cloud/getting-started/index.mdx#create-new-db-with-cloud).

:::

:::caution Connecting different Hasura instances to the same database

You can connect different Hasura instances (i.e. instances with different metadata) to the same database as long as 
there are no Event Triggers in any of the metadata. Event Triggers store their data in the underlying database and 
hence different instances acting on the same data can cause undefined behaviour during run-time. 
This should not be a problem if the Hasura instances have the same metadata.
