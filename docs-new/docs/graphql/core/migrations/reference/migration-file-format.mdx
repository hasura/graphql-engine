# Migration file format reference

## Introduction

The `config V3` migrations files generated by the CLI are pure SQL
files.

:::info Note

For `config v2`, see [Migration file format reference (config v2)](/graphql/core/migrations/config-v2/reference/migration-file-format.mdx).

:::

## Migration directory format

Each migration is stored inside a directory, which has the following
structure:

```bash
<version>_<name>/{up|down}.sql
```

A `version` which is the Unix timestamp in nanoseconds when the
migration was created is the first part of the name of the directory.
Followed by a `name` which is either manually added or auto-generated by
the console. The files inside this directory indicates what step this
is. `up.sql` file is supposed to have forward step(s), e.g. creating a
table. The `down.sql` file should include the corresponding rollback
step.
