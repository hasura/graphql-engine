# Built-in Monitoring in Hasura Cloud

Observability is a critical aspect of any application, and Hasura Cloud provides developers with a powerful set of tools
to monitor and debug their applications. In this document, we'll explore the observability features available in Hasura
Cloud and how they can help you build better applications.

## Error Reporting

Hasura Cloud provides detailed [error reporting](errors.mdx) for GraphQL queries and mutations. Whenever
an error occurs, Hasura Cloud captures the error message, query, and other relevant information, allowing you to quickly
identify and fix the issue. This feature is particularly useful when debugging complex GraphQL queries and mutations.

## Usage Summaries

Hasura Cloud provides [usage summaries](usage.mdx) for your GraphQL operations, allowing you to monitor
the performance of your application and identify any performance bottlenecks. The usage summaries can be filtered by
time range, operation type, and other parameters, making it easy to pinpoint performance issues.

## GraphQL Operations

Hasura Cloud provides detailed metrics for your [GraphQL operations](operations.mdx), including query
latency, request count, and error rate. This information can be used to monitor the performance of your application and
identify any issues that may be impacting your users.

## Websockets

Hasura Cloud supports [WebSockets](websockets.mdx), allowing you to build real-time applications that can
push data updates to the client in real-time without having to continuously poll the server. Hasura Cloud provides
detailed metrics for your WebSocket connections, including connection count, message count, and error rate.

## Subscription Workers

Hasura Cloud provides [subscription workers](subscription-workers.mdx) that can be used to process
subscriptions and deliver real-time updates to your clients. The subscription workers are fully managed and can be
scaled up or down based on your application's needs.

## Distributed Tracing

Hasura Cloud provides [distributed tracing](/observability/cloud-monitoring/tracing.mdx) capabilities, allowing you to trace requests
across multiple services and identify any performance bottlenecks. The tracing information can be used to optimize your
application's performance and ensure that it is running smoothly.

## Query Tags

Hasura Cloud provides [query tags](/observability/query-tags.mdx), which can be used to tag your GraphQL queries and
mutations with metadata. This metadata can be used to filter and group your usage summaries and metrics, making it easy
to identify trends and patterns in your application's usage.
