Introduction
------------

This page explains how to reset the state of migrations and create new migrations from the state that is on the server. This can be useful if the current migration state on your local machine is corrupted.

Step 1: Delete the local migrations
-----------------------------------

From your local project directory, delete all the contents in the ``migrations`` directory using the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   rm -r migrations/*

Step 2: Reset the migration history on the server
-------------------------------------------------

On the SQL tab of the Hasura console, run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   TRUNCATE hdb_catalog.schema_migrations;

Step 3: Pull the schema and metadata from the server
----------------------------------------------------

We will set up fresh migrations by pulling the schema and metadata from the server using the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

   ## create migration files - "this will only export public schema from postgres"

   hasura migrate create "init" --from-server

.. code-block:: bash

   ## note down the version
   ## mark the migration as applied on this server

   hasura migrate apply --version "<version>" --skip-execution

.. note::

   If you are using schemas other than ``public``, use the ``--schema <schema_name>`` flag to indicate each one of them in the create command. This flag can be used multiple times.


Step 4: Verify the status of the migrations
-------------------------------------------

Run the following command to verify the migration status:

.. code-block:: bash

   hasura migrate status   

You should see the new migrations!
