# MS SQL Server: Subscriptions

## Introduction

A GraphQL subscription is essentially a query where the client receives
an update whenever the value of any field changes upstream.

Subscriptions are supported for all kinds of queries. All the concepts
of [queries](/graphql/core/databases/ms-sql-server/queries/index.mdx) hold true for subscriptions as
well.

## Implementation

The Hasura GraphQL engine subscriptions are actually **live queries**,
i.e. a subscription will return the latest result of the query being
made and not necessarily all the individual events leading up to the
result. By default, updates are delivered to clients every **1 sec**.

## Convert a query to a subscription

You can turn any query into a subscription by simply replacing `query`
with `subscription` as the operation type.

:::info Caveat

Hasura follows the [GraphQL spec](https://graphql.github.io/graphql-spec/June2018/#sec-Single-root-field)
which allows for only one root field in a subscription.

## Use cases

- [Subscribe to the latest value of a particular field](/graphql/core/databases/ms-sql-server/subscriptions/use-cases.mdx#ms-sql-server-subscribe-field)
- [Subscribe to changes to a tableâ€™s entries](/graphql/core/databases/ms-sql-server/subscriptions/use-cases.mdx#ms-sql-server-subscribe-table)
- [Subscribe to the latest value of some derived data](/graphql/core/databases/ms-sql-server/subscriptions/use-cases.mdx#ms-sql-server-subscribe-derived)

## Communication protocol

Hasura GraphQL engine uses the [GraphQL over WebSocket
Protocol](https://github.com/apollographql/subscriptions-transport-ws/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md)
by the
[apollographql/subscriptions-transport-ws](https://github.com/apollographql/subscriptions-transport-ws)
library and the [GraphQL over WebSocket
Protocol](https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-ws/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md)
by the [graphql-ws](https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-ws) library for
sending and receiving events. The GraphQL engine uses the
`Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` header to determine the communication protocol
that'll be used. By default, the GraphQL engine will use the
`apollographql/subscriptions-transport-ws` protocol.

:::info Setting headers for subscriptions with Apollo client

If you are using Apollo Client, headers can be passed to a subscription
by setting `connectionParams` while [creating the wsLink](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/subscriptions/#client-setup):

```javascript {6-8}
// Create a WebSocket link:
const wsLink = new WebSocketLink({
  uri: `<graphql-endpoint>`,
  options: {
    reconnect: true,
    connectionParams: {
      headers: {headers-object}
    }
  }
});
```

See
[this](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/subscriptions/#authentication-over-websocket)
for more info on using `connectionParams`.

:::

## Cookies and WebSockets

The Hasura GraphQL engine will read cookies sent by the browser when
initiating a WebSocket connection. The browser will send the cookie only
if it is a secure cookie (`secure` flag in the cookie) and if the cookie
has a `HttpOnly` flag.

Hasura will read this cookie and use it as headers when resolving
authorization (i.e. when resolving the auth webhook).

### Cookies, WebSockets and CORS

As browsers don't enforce Same Origin Policy (SOP) for websockets, the
Hasura server enforces the CORS rules when accepting the websocket
connection.

It uses the provided CORS configuration (as per [Configure Cors](/graphql/core/deployment/graphql-engine-flags/config-examples.mdx#configure-cors)).

1.  When it is `*`, the cookie is read and the CORS check is not
    enforced.
2.  When there are explicit domains, the cookie will only be read if the
    request originates from one of the listed domains.
3.  If CORS is disabled, the default behaviour is that the cookie won't
    be read (because of potential security issues). To override the
    behaviour, you can use the flag `--ws-read-cookie` or the
    environment variable `HASURA_GRAPHQL_WS_READ_COOKIE`. See
    [GraphQL Engine server config reference](/graphql/core/deployment/graphql-engine-flags/reference.mdx) for the setting.
