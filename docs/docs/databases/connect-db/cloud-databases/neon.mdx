# Using Hasura Cloud with a Neon Serverless Postgres Database

## Introduction

This guide explains how to connect a new [Neon](https://neon.tech/) serverless Postgres database to a Hasura Cloud
project.

## Creating a New Neon Database

### Step 1: Sign up or log in to Hasura Cloud

Navigate to [Hasura Cloud](https://cloud.hasura.io/signup/?pg=docs&plcmt=body&cta=navigate-to-hasura-cloud&tech=default)
and sign up or log in.

### Step 2: Create a Hasura Cloud project

On the Hasura Cloud dashboard, create a new project:

After the project is initialized successfully, click on `Launch Console` to open the Hasura Console in your browser.

On the Hasura Console, navigate to `Data -> Manage -> Connect Database -> Create New Database`:

Click on `Connect Neon Database` to create and connect a new Postgres database to your Hasura project.

On the next step, you'll be prompted to Login/Sign up for Neon. We recommend `Continue with Hasura` for a seamless
experience.

After successful authorization, a new Neon Postgres database will be created and connected to your Hasura project with
the connection string associated with the environment variable `PG_DATABASE_URL`.

### Step 3 (optional): Load a template

Once the database is successfully connected, you can explore Hasura's GraphQL API by loading any of the templates from
the template gallery instantly.

For example: to get started, you could try the `Welcome to Hasura` template:

<Thumbnail src='/img/cloud-dbs/neon/hasura_hello_world_template.png' alt='Hello World Template' widht='700px' />

This installs a schema with data that you can now query using your Hasura GraphQL API from the `API` tab.

Voil√†! You are ready to start developing.

:::info Note

You can visit the Neon console from the `Data` tab to manage your created database.

## Migrating an existing database to Neon

If you want to migrate your existing database to Neon, you must use Postgres's `pg_dump` utility to copy over your
database.

```bash
pg_dump -h <host> -U <username> <dbname> | psql -h pg.neon.tech
```

For more info, follow
[Neon's detailed guide for importing a database](https://neon.tech/docs/how-to-guides/import-an-existing-database/).

:::info Note

If you're migrating from Heroku, check out Neon's platform-specific
[migration guide](https://neon.tech/docs/how-to-guides/hasura-heroku-migration/).

## Neon Free Tier

With Neon's Free Tier, you can create up to three projects with the following limits:

- Project data size is limited to 10GB
- The Point in Time Reset (PITR) window is limited to 7 days of reasonable usage
- The compute node is limited to 1 vCPU and 256MB of RAM

For more info, check out Neon's
[Technical Preview Free Tier](https://neon.tech/docs/reference/technical-preview-free-tier/).

:::info Note

If you've already reached the free-tier limit of three databases, please head to your
[Neon console](https://console.neon.tech/) and delete an unused database to be able to create and connect a new one from
the Hasura Console.
