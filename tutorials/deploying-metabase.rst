Analytics is a critical part of any application development journey. As a developer (*or a manager*), it is important to keep track of critical metrics like number of app users, etc. and may be even set up daily notifications for them. Taking advantage of the fact that an open-source relational database, PostgreSQL, is part of the Hasura platform, several open source analytics products are available that can be deployed on the platform. Metabase is one such Do-it-yourself (DIY) analytics product that works seamlessly with PostgreSQL. A tutorial on how to deploy Metabase on your Hasura project was originally published here:
