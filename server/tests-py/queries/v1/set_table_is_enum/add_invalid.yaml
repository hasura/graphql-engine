  error: |
    the table "employees" cannot be used as an enum for the following reasons:
      • the table’s primary key ("id") must have type "text", not type "integer"
      • the table must have exactly one primary key and optionally one comment column, not 4 columns (favorite_color, gets_paid_on, id, name)
