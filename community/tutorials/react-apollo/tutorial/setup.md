In this tutorial, youâ€™ll use the following technologies for building the app:

- Frontend
    - React v0.16.3
    - Apollo Client 2.1

- Backend
    - Hasura GraphQL Engine

The good news is that, the backend is already set up and running live at `https://react-apollo-todo-demo.hasura.app/v1alpha1/graphql`

Some parts of the frontend (non-graphql code) has already been written for convenience. You will be cloning a boilerplate to get started in the next step.
