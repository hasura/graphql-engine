For this tutorial, the GraphQL backend and the basic app UI is already ready.
Our task will be convert the "static" UI into a working realtime app.

### Download and run the boilerplate


1. Download the boilerplate at: [https://learn.hasura.io/graphql/flutter-graphql/boilerplate.zip](https://learn.hasura.io/graphql/flutter-graphql/boilerplate.zip)
2. Unzip and make sure you're in the `app-boilerplate` directory.
3. Run this app in your phone or emulator using `Flutter SDK`
    - `flutter run`
4. Signup/login as a user to load the todo app screen

After you login, you should get something like this:

### Load GraphiQL to play with your GraphQL APIs

1. Head to [https://learn.hasura.io/graphql/graphiql](https://learn.hasura.io/graphql/graphiql?tutorial=react-native)
2. Log in (so that you can test the GraphQL APIs with a valid user token)

This is what you should see after the steps above:
