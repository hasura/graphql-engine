# Get Support

## Introduction

As a Hasura user, you can request support in a number of ways. Below, you'll find three options.

### Hasura Support Portal

You can visit our [support portal](https://hasurahelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and — optionally — sign in
before filling out the form:

The more complete your description, the easier it will be to help you resolve your issue. Should you have the resources,
please attach any assets (such as screenshots or screen recordings) that may help a support representative assist you.

When your form is complete, click `Submit` to create your ticket.

### Via Hasura Cloud

If your project is hosted on Hasura Cloud, you can submit a support request directly from your Hasura Cloud dashboard.
Click on `Help & Support` in the left-hand sidenav and create a new ticket:

using the following [guidelines](https://hasura.io/support/#support-priority-definitions) to aid us in setting
priorities.
