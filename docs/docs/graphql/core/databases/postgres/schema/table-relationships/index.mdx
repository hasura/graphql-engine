# Postgres: Relationships between tables/views

## Introduction

To make [nested object queries](/graphql/core/databases/postgres/queries/nested-object-queries.mdx), the
tables/views in your database need to be connected via relationships.

Let's say we have the following tables in our database: `authors`,
`passport_infos`, `articles` and `tags`.

## Table relationships

The tables/views in any relational database are typically related to
each other via one of the following types of table relationships:

| Type           | Example                      | Meaning                                                                                                      |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `one-to-one`   | `owner` and `passport_infos` | <ul><li> an `owner` can have one `passport_info` </li><li> a `passport_info` can have one `owner` </li></ul> |
| `one-to-many`  | `authors` and `articles`     | <ul><li> an `author` can have many `articles` </li><li> an `article` can have one `author` </li></ul>        |
| `many-to-many` | `articles` and `tags`        | <ul><li> an `article` can have many `tags` </li><li> a `tag` can have many `articles` </li></ul>             |

## GraphQL schema relationships {#pg-graphql-relationships}

Each table relationship, as you can see from the above section, will
have two component relationships (one in either direction) in the
GraphQL schema. These relationships can be one of the following types:

| Type                               | Example                              | Meaning                                                                           |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `object relationship` (one-to-one) | an `article` can have one `author`   | an `article` object will have a single nested author object called `author`       |
| `array relationship` (one-to-many) | an `author` can have many `articles` | an `author` object will have an array of nested article objects called `articles` |

:::info Note

The relationship name is used to refer to the nested objects in queries.
For example, "`articles`" of an `author` and "`author`" of an `article`.

## Managing GraphQL relationships

See the following to manage the object/array relationships between
tables/views for the GraphQL schema:

- [Postgres: Creating relationships](/graphql/core/databases/postgres/schema/table-relationships/create.mdx)
- [Postgres: Renaming relationships](/graphql/core/databases/postgres/schema/table-relationships/rename.mdx)

## Table relationships modelling guides

The following guides will help you model the different types of table
relationships in the database:

- [Modelling one-to-one table relationships](/graphql/core/guides/data-modelling/one-to-one.mdx)
- [Modelling one-to-many table relationships](/graphql/core/guides/data-modelling/one-to-many.mdx)
- [Modelling many-to-many table relationships](/graphql/core/guides/data-modelling/many-to-many.mdx)
