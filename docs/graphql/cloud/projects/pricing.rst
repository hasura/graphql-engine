Switching pricing plans
-----------------------

Switch from free tier to pay-as-you-go
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once the free tier data limit is exhausted, the project becomes inactive. In order to keep it active, you can switch to the pay-as-you-go plan.

Go to ``Projects`` and click on the project you'd like to change.

Now click on the ``Usage tab``. To upgrade to the pay-as-you-go plan, click on the ``Upgrade`` button:

Your project is now running on the pay-as-you-go plan.

Switch from pay-as-you-go to free tier
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Go to ``Projects`` and click on the project you'd like to change. 

Now click on the ``Usage`` tab and then click on the link ``Switch to the free tier`` on the bottom right:

You'll be charged as per the pay-as-you-go plan until the end of the day. From the next day onwards, the project will be on the free tier. 
If the free tier limit is exhausted, the project might become inactive.

Switch to and from enterprise
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to upgrade to the enterprise plan or to switch back to another plan, please `contact our sales team <https://hasura.io/contact-us/?type=hasuraenterprise>`__.
