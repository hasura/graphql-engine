# Get Started with Amazon Redshift

:::caution Redshift Beta Availability

The Hasura Amazon Redshift connector is currently available in beta for all Hasura Cloud offerings and for Hasura
Enterprise Edition customers. Once the Redshift connector is generally available (GA), it will be available only for
Hasura Cloud Enterprise and Enterprise Edition customers.

:::

:::caution Redshift Beta Regions

At this time, Redshift access is only available on AWS Regions.

:::

To try Hasura with Amazon Redshift, you'll need your own new or existing Amazon Redshift database.

Here are 2 ways you can get started with Hasura:

1.  [Hasura Cloud](/databases/redshift/getting-started/cloud.mdx) : You'll need to be able to access your Amazon
    Redshift service from Hasura Cloud.
2.  [Docker](/databases/redshift/getting-started/docker.mdx): Run Hasura with Docker and then connect your Amazon
    Redshift service to Hasura.

:::info Using Kubernetes?

We have Helm charts available for deploying Hasura on Kubernetes. Check out
[more information here](/deployment/deployment-guides/kubernetes-helm.mdx) and see the
[`enterprise-stack` here](https://github.com/hasura/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/hasura-enterprise-stack).
