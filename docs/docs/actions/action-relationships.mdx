# Action Relationships

## Introduction

Actions are a way to extend your GraphQL schema with custom queries or mutations which call a REST endpoint. It is a
typical case that an Action's response is actually related to existing objects in the schema and as such, should be
connected with the rest of the graph.

For example, a custom `insertAuthor` action will be related to the `author` object in the schema. Hence, we would want
to be able to get information about the `author` from the graph as a response of the `insertAuthor` mutation.

## Support for Action relationships

Below, you can find information about the different types of relationship patterns that are supported for Actions.

| Relationship Type       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Action to Database      | **Joins are supported _from_ Actions _to_ tables in Postgres databases.** However, Action to database joins are not currently supported for other databases.                                                                               |
| Action to Action        | Actions can be joined to each other by using a Hasura instance as a federation gateway, or "parent" supergraph. You can find more information about this pattern [here](/actions/action-relationships.mdx#action-to-action-relationships). |
| Action to Remote Schema | An Action cannot be joined to a Remote Schema.                                                                                                                                                                                             |

## Using an Action's output types in relationships

Actions can be connected to the rest of the graph by setting up relationships on its return output type.

This allows complex responses to be returned as an Action's response by traversing the graph via the output type's
relationships.

**For example**, given the action:

```graphql
type Mutation {
  updateAuthor(id: Int!, name: String!): UpdateAuthorOutput
}

type UpdateAuthorOutput {
  author_id: Int!
}
```

We can create an object relationship called `updatedAuthor` between the `UpdateAuthorOutput` object type and the
`author` table using the `UpdateAuthorOutput.author_id` and `author.id` fields.

The object type will now be modified as:

```graphql {3}
type UpdateAuthorOutput {
  author_id: Int!
  updatedAuthor: author
}
```

Now we can make a mutation request with a complex response such as:

```graphql
mutation updateAuthorAndGetArticles($id: Int, $name: String) {
  updateAuthor(id: $id, name: $name) {
    author_id
    updatedAuthor {
      id
      name
      articles {
        id
        title
      }
    }
  }
}
```

See more details at [custom object type relationships](/actions/types.mdx)

### Creating relationships for custom object types

You can create relationships for custom output types by:

<Tabs groupId="user-preference" className="api-tabs">
<TabItem value="console" label="Console">

Head to the `Actions -> [action-name] -> Relationships` tab in the Console for the Action returning the output type.

Set the output type relationship as shown below:

<Thumbnail src="/img/actions/actions-relationship.png" alt="Console action relationship" />

Hit `Save` to create the relationship.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

Go to `metadata/actions.yaml` in the Hasura Project directory.

Update the definition of the `UpdateAuthorOutput` object type as:

```yaml {4-11}
- custom_types
  - objects
    - name: UpdateAuthorOutput
      relationships:
      - name: updatedAuthor
        type: object
        remote_table:
          schema: public
          name: author
        field_mapping:
          author_id: id
```

Save the changes and run `hasura metadata apply` to create the relationship.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="api" label="API">

Action relationships can be added while defining custom types via the
[set_custom_types](/api-reference/metadata-api/custom-types.mdx#metadata-set-custom-types) Metadata API:

```http {20-29}
POST /v1/metadata HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
X-Hasura-Role: admin

{
  "type": "set_custom_types",
  "args": {
    "scalars": [],
    "enums": [],
    "input_objects": [],
    "objects": [
      {
        "name": "UpdateAuthorOutput",
        "fields": [
          {
            "name": "author_id",
            "type": "Int!"
          }
        ],
        "relationships": [
          {
            "name": "updatedAuthor",
            "type": "object",
            "remote_table": "author",
            "field_mapping": {
              "author_id": "id"
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Action to Action relationships

Hasura supports creating relationships between data originating from different REST APIs which have been added as
Actions by using a Hasura instance as a federation gateway, or "parent" supergraph.

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/actions/data-federation_action-to-action-joins.png"
  alt="Join Actions to Actions using self-referential Remote Schemas"
/>

To achieve this we can add a "child" Hasura instance to a "parent" or "gateway" Hasura instance as a Remote Schema. This
allows relationships to be created between types from two different Actions in the child instance by creating a
[Remote Schema to Remote Schema](/remote-schemas/remote-relationships/remote-schema-relationships.mdx) relationship on
the same Remote Schema.

:::info Remote Schema Action to Action workaround

Currently, this method of adding a child instance as a Remote Schema to achieve Action to Action relationships is a
viable and effective workaround. In the future we will be adding a more native method of creating Action to Action
relationships without utilizing Remote Schemas.
