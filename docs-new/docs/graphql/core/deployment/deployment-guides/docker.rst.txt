## Introduction

This guide will help you deploy the Hasura GraphQL engine and a Postgres
database to store its metadata using Docker Compose.

## Deploying Hasura using Docker

### Prerequisites

-   [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
-   [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Step 1: Get the docker-compose file

The
[hasura/graphql-engine/install-manifests](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/tree/stable/install-manifests)
repo contains all installation manifests required to deploy Hasura
anywhere. Get the docker compose file from there:

``` bash
# in a new directory run
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hasura/graphql-engine/stable/install-manifests/docker-compose/docker-compose.yaml
# or run
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hasura/graphql-engine/stable/install-manifests/docker-compose/docker-compose.yaml -o docker-compose.yml
```

## Step 2: Run Hasura GraphQL engine

The following command will run Hasura GraphQL engine along with a
Postgres database to store its metadata.

``` bash
$ docker-compose up -d
```

Check if the containers are running:

``` bash
$ docker ps

CONTAINER ID IMAGE                 ... CREATED STATUS PORTS          ...
097f58433a2b hasura/graphql-engine ... 1m ago  Up 1m  8080->8080/tcp ...
b0b1aac0508d postgres              ... 1m ago  Up 1m  5432/tcp       ...
```

## Securing the GraphQL endpoint

To make sure that your GraphQL endpoint and the Hasura console are not
publicly accessible, you need to configure an admin secret key.

### Run the Docker container with an admin-secret env var

``` yaml
graphql-engine:
  image: hasura/graphql-engine:v2.0.0
  environment:
    HASURA_GRAPHQL_METADATA_DATABASE_URL: postgres://postgres:postgrespassword@postgres:5432/postgres
    HASURA_GRAPHQL_ADMIN_SECRET: myadminsecretkey
  ...
```

<div class="note">

<div class="title">

Note

</div>

The `HASURA_GRAPHQL_ADMIN_SECRET` should never be passed from the client
to the Hasura GraphQL engine as it would give the client full admin
rights to your Hasura instance. See `auth` for information on setting up
authentication.

</div>

> <div class="admonition dhc">

> Using collaborators as an alternative to Hasura Admin Secret sharing
> with Hasura Cloud
>
> Hasura Cloud offers console collaborators which avoids sharing the
> <span class="title-ref">HASURA-ADMIN-SECRET</span> with those that
> shouldn't have unrestricted access to your project. For more
> information about collaborator management, see
> `Collaborators in Hasura Cloud <manage_project_collaborators>`.

## Hasura GraphQL engine server logs

You can check the logs of the Hasura GraphQL engine deployed using
Docker by checking the logs of the GraphQL engine container:

``` bash
$ docker ps

CONTAINER ID IMAGE                 ... CREATED STATUS PORTS          ...
097f58433a2b hasura/graphql-engine ... 1m ago  Up 1m  8080->8080/tcp ...
b0b1aac0508d postgres              ... 1m ago  Up 1m  5432/tcp       ...


$ docker logs 097f58433a2b

{"timestamp":"2018-10-09T11:20:32.054+0000", "level":"info", "type":"http-log", "detail":{"status":200, "query_hash":"01640c6dd131826cff44308111ed40d7fbd1cbed", "http_version":"HTTP/1.1", "query_execution_time":3.0177627e-2, "request_id":null, "url":"/v1/graphql", "user":{"x-hasura-role":"admin"}, "ip":"127.0.0.1", "response_size":209329, "method":"POST", "detail":null}}
...
```

**See:**

-   <https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging> for more details
    on logging in Docker.
-   `hge_logs` for more details on Hasura logs.

## Updating Hasura GraphQL engine

This guide will help you update the Hasura GraphQL engine running with
Docker. This guide assumes that you already have Hasura GraphQL engine
running with Docker.

### Step 1: Check the latest release version

The current latest version is:

<code>hasura/graphql-engine:<span class="latest-release-tag">latest</span></code>

All the versions can be found at:
<https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/releases>

### Step 2: Update the Docker image

In the `docker-compose` command that you're running, update the image
tag to this latest version.

For example, if you had:

<code>
  graphql-engine:<br/>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;image: hasura/graphql-engine:v1.2.0
</code>

you should change it to:

<code>
  graphql-engine:<br/>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;image: hasura/graphql-engine:<span class="latest-release-tag">latest</span>
</code>

<div class="title">

Note

If you are downgrading to an older version of the GraphQL engine you
might need to downgrade your metadata catalogue version as described in
`downgrade_hge`
