# Postgres: Database to Remote Schema relationships

## Introduction

Database to Remote Schema relationships extend the concept of joining data across
tables, to joining across tables and remote GraphQL sources. Once you
create relationships between types from your database and types created
from remote schemas, you can then "join" them by running GraphQL queries.

These APIs can be custom GraphQL servers you write, third party SaaS
APIs, or even other Hasura instances.

Because Hasura is meant to be a GraphQL server that you can expose
directly to your apps, Hasura also handles security and authorization
while providing remote joins.

:::info Note

To see example use cases, check out this [blog
post](https://hasura.io/blog/remote-joins-a-graphql-api-to-join-database-and-other-data-sources/).

Remote schema relationships from Postgres are supported from versions `v1.3.0` and
above.

## Create remote schema relationships

### Step 0: Add a remote schema and a database

Add a remote schema and a database as described [here](/graphql/core/remote-schemas/adding-schema.mdx)
and [here](/graphql/core/databases/connect-db.mdx), if not already added.

### Step 1: Define and create the relationship

The following fields can be defined for a remote schema relationship:

- **Name**: Define a name for the relationship.
- **Remote Schema**: Select a remote schema among all the ones you've
  created.
- **Configuration**: Set up the join configuration, to inject values
  as input arguments of the remote schema field.
  - **From column**: Input injected from table column values.
  - **From static value**: Input injected from a static value of
    your choice.

For example, let's assume that our database has a table
`order(id int, user_id int)` and we've added a remote schema
`user-remote-schema`.

1.  We name the relationship `user`.
2.  We select the `user-remote-schema` that we've added.
3.  We set up the config to join the `id` input argument of our
    remote schema field to the `user_id` column of this table (in this
    case, the `order` table).

- Head to the `Data -> [table-name] -> Relationships` tab.
- Click the `Add a remote relationship` button.

- Define the relationship and hit `Save`.

Update the `databases > [database-name] > tables > [table-name].yaml` file in the `metadata` directory:

```yaml {4-13}
- table:
    schema: public
    name: order
  remote_relationships:
  - name: user
    definition:
      remote_field:
        user:
          arguments:
            id: $user_id
      hasura_fields:
        - user_id
      remote_schema: user-remote-schema
```

Apply the metadata by running:

```bash
hasura metadata apply
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="api" label="API">

You can add a remote schema relationship by using the
[pg_create_remote_relationship](/graphql/core/api-reference/metadata-api/remote-relationships.mdx#metadata-pg-create-remote-relationship) metadata API:

```http
POST /v1/metadata HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
X-Hasura-Role: admin

{
  "type": "pg_create_remote_relationship",
  "args": {
    "name": "user",
    "source": "pg1",
    "table": { "name": "order", "schema": "public" },
    "hasura_fields": ["user_id"],
    "remote_schema": "user-remote-schema",
    "remote_field": {
      "user": {
        "arguments": {
          "id": "$user_id"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Step 2: Explore with GraphiQL

In the `API` tab, test out your remote schema relationship.

<GraphiQLIDE
  query={`query {
  order {
    id
    user_id
    user {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}`}
  response={`{
  "data": {
    "order": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "user_id": 2,
        "user": {
          "id": 2,
          "name": "Bob"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}`}
/>

## Remote schema relationship permissions {#pg-remote-schema-relationship-permissions}

Remote schema relationship permissions are derived from the
[remote schema permissions](/graphql/core/remote-schemas/auth/remote-schema-permissions.mdx) defined for the
role. When a remote relationship permission cannot be derived, the remote
relationship field will not be added to the schema for the role.

Some cases in which a remote relationship permission cannot be derived are:

1.  There are no remote schema permissions defined for the role.
2.  The role doesn't have access to the field or types that are used by
    the remote relationship.

:::info Note

Remote relationship permissions apply only if remote schema permissions
are enabled in GraphQL engine.
