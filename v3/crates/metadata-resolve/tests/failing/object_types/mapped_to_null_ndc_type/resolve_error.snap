The following issues were raised but disallowed by compatibility configuration:

The field 'location' in object type 'institution (in subgraph default)' cannot be mapped to data connector 'custom (in subgraph default)' field 'institution.location' because: Type 'location! (in subgraph default)' is not compatible with NDC type 'Nullable { underlying_type: Named { name: TypeName("location") } }' - Expected a non-nullable type
