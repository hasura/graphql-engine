# Postgres views

## Introduction

A [Postgres view](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createview.html) is a
virtual table in Postgres. It represents the result of a query to one or
more underlying tables in Postgres. Views are used to simplify complex
queries since these queries are defined once in the view, and can then
be directly queried via the same.

:::info Note

Please refer to the Postgres documentation for more details on [standard views](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createview.html) and
[materialized views](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/rules-materializedviews.html).

:::

## Standard views

[Standard views](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createview.html)
represent the result of a query without actually storing data.

### Examples

**View with authors whose rating is larger than 6:**

```sql
CREATE VIEW popular_authors AS
  SELECT name, rating
  FROM authors
  WHERE rating > 6;
```

The created view can now be queried as follows:

```sql
SELECT name, rating from popular_authors;
```

**View with authors ordered by their rating:**

```sql
CREATE VIEW authors_ordered_by_rating AS
    SELECT name, rating
    FROM authors
    ORDER BY rating;
```

The created view can now be queried as follows:

```sql
SELECT name, rating from authors_ordered_by_rating;
```

## Materialized views

Compared to the standard view described above, [materialized views](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/rules-materializedviews.html)
**do** store data physically in the database. Materialized views are
used if data from complex queries needs to be accessed quickly.

### Example

<div id="pg-materialized-view-example" />

**Materialized view with authors whose rating is larger than 6 and who
are active, ordered by rating:**

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW popular_active_authors AS
    SELECT name, rating
    FROM authors
    WHERE rating > 6 AND is_active = TRUE
    ORDER BY rating;
```

The created materialized view can now be queried as follows:

```sql
SELECT name, rating from popular_active_authors;
```

### Refreshing materialized views

Materialized views don't always have the most recent data. Since the
result of a query is stored in a materialized view like in a cache, you
need to make sure to refresh it periodically:

```sql
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW popular_active_authors;
```

Materialized views can be refreshed when their underlying source data
changes using [Postgres triggers](/graphql/core/guides/postgres/triggers.mdx).

## Postgres views & Hasura

After creating a view, you can expose it over your GraphQL API and query
it like a normal table.

See [this page](/graphql/core/databases/postgres/schema/views.mdx) for more info on how to create and
expose views in Hasura.
