## What are stored procedures?

:::tip Supported from

stored procedures are supported from `v2.26.0`.

:::

stored procedures can be used to track MS SQL Server
[stored procedures](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/stored-procedures/stored-procedures-database-engine)
and execute them via the Hasura GraphQL Engine.

SQL Server stored procedures are built-in or user-defined Transact-SQL statements that can be used to encapsulate some
custom business logic or extend the built-in SQL functions and operators.

stored procedures support is a Cloud and Enterprise feature of Hasura.

:::info Supported features

Currently, only read-only stored procedures are supported, and Hasura aggregations or relationships are not supported at
this time.

:::

## Example: Execute a built-in stored procedure

We’ll start with an example. Let’s use this new feature to execute a built-in stored procedure from our Hasura API. If
you’d like some reference documentation, scroll down, and also take a look at the
[Logical Models documentation](/schema/ms-sql-server/logical-models/index.mdx).

For our case, we would like to get some information about our database. Specifically, which tables are currently defined
in the database. On SQL Server we can do that by executing the
[`sp_tables`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sp-tables-transact-sql)
stored procedure.

We can create a Logical Model representing the results set:

:::info Only creatable via the API

Currently, stored procedures can only be created using the API. Console and CLI support will be added in a future
release.

:::

<Tabs groupId="user-preference" className="api-tabs">
<TabItem value="api" label="API">

```http
POST /v1/metadata HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
X-Hasura-Role: admin

{
  "type": "mssql_track_logical_model",
  "args": {
    "source": "mssql",
    "name": "tables",
    "fields": [
      {
        "name": "TABLE_QUALIFIER",
        "type": "sysname",
        "nullable": true
      },
      {
        "name": "TABLE_OWNER",
        "type": "sysname",
        "nullable": true
      },
      {
        "name": "TABLE_NAME",
        "type": "sysname",
        "nullable": true
      },
      {
        "name": "TABLE_TYPE",
        "type": "varchar(32)",
        "nullable": true
      },
      {
        "name": "REMARKS",
        "type": "varchar(254)",
        "nullable": true
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

We can then track a stored procedure that returns that result set. Additionally, we can add arguments which can be
passed to the stored procedure from the GraphQL API. We'll include the `table_type` arguments which can be used to
filter tables, system tables, and views.

:::info Validation during tracking is not currently supported

Currently, stored procedures are not checked against the Logical Model to validate that they return the expected result
set or that the arguments match with the stored procedure's arguments. This means that if there's a mismatch between the
database stored procedure and the Logical Model or the arguments, an error will be thrown when running a query.

:::

<Tabs groupId="user-preference" className="api-tabs">
<TabItem value="api" label="API">

```http
POST /v1/metadata HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
X-Hasura-Role: admin

{
  "type": "mssql_track_stored_procedure",
  "args": {
    "source": "mssql",
    "stored_procedure": "sp_tables",
    "configuration": {
      "exposed_as": "query"
    },
    "arguments": {
      "table_type": {
        "type": "varchar"
      }
    },
    "returns": "tables"
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

All that’s left is for us to make a GraphQL query to select the tables which are currently defined in the database:

```graphql
query sp {
  sp_tables(args: { table_type: "'TABLE'" }, limit: 3) {
    TABLE_QUALIFIER
    TABLE_OWNER
    TABLE_NAME
    TABLE_TYPE
  }
}
```

When we run this GraphQL query, we get the following results:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "sp_tables": [
      {
        "TABLE_QUALIFIER": "master",
        "TABLE_OWNER": "dbo",
        "TABLE_NAME": "MSreplication_options",
        "TABLE_TYPE": "TABLE"
      },
      {
        "TABLE_QUALIFIER": "master",
        "TABLE_OWNER": "dbo",
        "TABLE_NAME": "spt_fallback_db",
        "TABLE_TYPE": "TABLE"
      },
      {
        "TABLE_QUALIFIER": "master",
        "TABLE_OWNER": "dbo",
        "TABLE_NAME": "spt_fallback_dev",
        "TABLE_TYPE": "TABLE"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Next, we'll look at the process of tracking a stored procedure in more detail.

## Tracking a stored procedure

### Step 1. Create a Logical Model

In order to represent the structure of the data returned by the query, we first create a Logical Model.

:::info Permissions and Logical Models

Note that this Logical Model has no attached permissions and therefore will only be available to the admin role. See the
[Logical Model documentation](/schema/ms-sql-server/logical-models/index.mdx) for information on attaching permissions.

:::

<Tabs groupId="user-preference" className="api-tabs">
<TabItem value="api" label="API">

```http
POST /v1/metadata HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
X-Hasura-Role: admin

{
  "type": "mssql_track_logical_model",
  "args": {
    "source": "default",
    "name": "<name>",
    "fields": [
      {
        "name": "<field name>",
        "type": "<SQL Server field type>",
        "nullable": false | true,
        "description": "<optional field description>"
      },
      ...
    ]
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Step 2. Track a stored procedure

Once the Logical Model is defined, we can use it to define the query:

<Tabs groupId="user-preference" className="api-tabs">
<TabItem value="api" label="API">

```http
POST /v1/metadata HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
X-Hasura-Role: admin

{
  "type": "mssql_track_stored_procedure",
  "args": {
    "source": <source-name>,
    "stored_procedure": <name> | { "schema": <schema-name>, "name": <procedure-name> },
    "arguments": {
      <name>: {
        "type": "<type>",
        "nullable": false | true,
        "description": <string>
      }
    },
    "configuration": {
      "exposed_as": "query",
      "custom_name": <custom-name>
    },
    "returns": <logical-model-name>
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Arguments

The stored procedure can take arguments, which are specified in the metadata. When making a GraphQL query, the arguments
are specified using the `args` parameter of the query root field. If the stored procedure does not take arguments, the
`args` parameter should be omitted from the GraphQL query.

## Using the stored procedure

You can make a GraphQL request using the specified root field name just as you would any other GraphQL query. When
making a query, the arguments are specified using the `args` parameter of the query root field.

```graphql
query {
  <stored procedure name>(
    [args: {"<argument name>": <argument value>, ...},]
    [where: ...,]
    [order_by: ..., distinct_on: ...,]
    [limit: ..., offset: ...]
  ) {
    <field 1>
    <field 2>
    ...
  }
}
```

Currently running a stored procedure has the following caveats:

- The stored procedure must currently be read-only.
- The return type of the query must match with the Logical Model.

## Query functionality

Just like tables, stored procedures generate GraphQL types with the ability to further break down the data. You can find
more information in the relevant documentation for [filtering](/queries/ms-sql-server/query-filters.mdx),
[sorting](/queries/ms-sql-server/sorting.mdx), and [pagination](/queries/ms-sql-server/pagination.mdx).

## Mutations

Currently, only read-only stored procedures are supported. All stored procedures are run in a read-only transaction
where supported to enforce this constraint.

A future release will allow mutations to be specified using stored procedures.

## Permissions

stored procedures will inherit the permissions of the Logical Model that they return. See the
[documentation on Logical Models](/schema/ms-sql-server/logical-models/index.mdx) for an explanation of how to add
permissions.
