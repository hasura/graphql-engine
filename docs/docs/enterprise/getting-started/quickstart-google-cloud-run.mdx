# Quickstart with Google Cloud Run

<div className="badge badge--primary heading-badge">Available on: Self-hosted Enterprise</div>

## Introduction

This tutorial will help you run Hasura Enterprise Edition as a Google Cloud Run service using the `gcloud` CLI.

**This guide requires HGE versions `v2.12.0` and above.** Installation instructions are below.

## Deploying Hasura EE on Cloud Run

### Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes that the following prerequisites have been met:

- To deploy Hasura EE, you will need a license key. [Please contact Hasura Sales](mailto:sales@hasura.io) if you do not
  already have one.
- The latest version of the `gcloud` CLI is installed and configured. For more information about installing or upgrading
  your gcloud CLI, see [Installing the gcloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install).
- Your `gcloud` user has the
  [required permissions](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/reference/iam/roles#additional-configuration) to deploy a
  cloud run service.
- You have a Postgres database for storing Metadata and Redis for caching / rate limiting, preferably a managed service,
  see [Creating a Cloud SQL PostgresSQL instance](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/create-instance) and
  [Creating a Memorystore for Redis](https://cloud.google.com/memorystore/docs/redis/create-instance-console).
- You have a Serverless VPC Access Connector to make the Postgres and Redis datastores accessible from Cloud Run, see
  [Creating a Serverless VPC Access connector](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/configure-serverless-vpc-access).

### Step 1: Get the Cloud Run env vars file

The [install manifests repo](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/tree/master/install-manifests) contains all
installation manifests required to deploy Hasura anywhere. Get the Cloud Run env vars file from there:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hasura/graphql-engine/stable/install-manifests/enterprise/google-cloud-run/env.yaml
```

### Step 2: Set the license key, Metadata database URL, Redis database URL and the admin secret

Edit `env.yaml` and set the right values:

```yaml
HASURA_GRAPHQL_EE_LICENSE_KEY: '<license key>'
HASURA_GRAPHQL_METADATA_DATABASE_URL: postgres://postgres:postgrespassword@postgres:5432/postgres
HASURA_GRAPHQL_REDIS_URL: 'redis://redis:6379'
HASURA_GRAPHQL_RATE_LIMIT_REDIS_URL: 'redis://redis:6379'
HASURA_GRAPHQL_ADMIN_SECRET: myadminsecretkey
```

Examples of `HASURA_GRAPHQL_METADATA_DATABASE_URL`:

- `postgres://admin:password@db-ip:5432/my_db`
- `postgres://admin:@db-ip:5432/my_db` _(if there is no password)_

Examples of `HASURA_GRAPHQL_REDIS_URL` and `HASURA_GRAPHQL_RATE_LIMIT_REDIS_URL`:

- `redis://admin:password@redis-ip:6379`
- `redis://redis-ip:6379` _(if there is no password)_

:::info Note

- If your **password contains special characters** (e.g. #, %, $, @, etc.), you need to URL encode them in the
  `HASURA_GRAPHQL_METADATA_DATABASE_URL` env var (e.g. %40 for @).

- The Hasura GraphQL Engine needs access permissions on your Postgres database as described in
  [Postgres permissions](/deployment/postgres-requirements.mdx#postgres-permissions).

- The `HASURA_GRAPHQL_ADMIN_SECRET` should never be passed from the client to the Hasura GraphQL Engine as it would give
  the client full admin rights to your Hasura instance. See [Authentication & Authorization](/auth/index.mdx) for
  information on setting up authentication.

- Convert confidential environment variables such as Postgres / Redis URLs, admin / metrics secrets to fetch them from
  secrets, [see here for more information](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/configuring/secrets).

### Step 3: Copy the Hasura graphql-engine image to the GCR registry

Cloud Run does not allow using images from Dockerhub. Due to this limitation it's necessary to pull the Hasura
graphql-engine image from Dockerhub and push it to your container registry,
[see here for more information](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/deploying#other-registries).

This can be done using the below steps:

<pre>
  <code>
    VERSION=
    <LatestRelease />
    <br />
    docker pull hasura/graphql-engine:$VERSION
    <br />
    docker tag hasura/graphql-engine:$VERSION gcr.io/&lt;MY_PROJECT_ID&gt;/hasura/graphql-engine:$VERSION
    <br />
    docker push gcr.io/&lt;MY_PROJECT_ID&gt;/hasura/graphql-engine:$VERSION
  </code>
</pre>

### Step 4: Deploy the service

Update the image and vpc connector values in the below commmand.

```bash {2,4}
gcloud run deploy hasura \
  --image=gcr.io/<MY_PROJECT_ID>/hasura/graphql-engine:tag \
  --env-vars-file=env.yaml \
  --vpc-connector=<vpc-connector-name> \
  --allow-unauthenticated \
  --max-instances=1 \
  --cpu=1 \
  --memory=2048Mi \
  --port=8080
```

Wait for the deployment to finish. Upon successful completion, a success message is displayed along with the URL of the
deployed service.

Click the displayed URL link to open the unique and stable endpoint of the Hasura service.
