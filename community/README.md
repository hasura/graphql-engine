# Community

This directory contains community-contributed code and content that supplements Hasura GraphQL Engine. It includes several example applications built using GraphQL Engine to demonstrate its features, several boilerplates for users to get started with auth webhooks, triggers, etc. and some community tooling around the Engine.

The following categories of community content can be found in their respective sub-folders:

- [Boilerplates](boilerplates)
- [Sample Apps](sample-apps)
- [Tools](tools)

Details on how to deploy and/or modify the code is specified in various READMEs.
