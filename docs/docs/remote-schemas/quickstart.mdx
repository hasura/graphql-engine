# Quickstart

## Overview

This quickstart will help you connect your first Remote Schema.

<SampleAppBlock />

## Step 1: Click Add

From the Console, navigate to the `Remote Schemas` page. At the top of the page, click `Add`:

/>

## Step 2: Enter the basics

Name this remote schema `countries_api` and enter the following value in the `GraphQL Service URL` field:

```
https://countries.trevorblades.com/graphql
```

  width="1146px"
/>

Scroll to the bottom of the page and click `Add Remote Schema`.

After clicking this button, you'll see the details of your newly connected API:

:::tip That's it?!

Yep, that's it! You've just joined a remote GraphQL service with your Hasura GraphQL API ðŸ”¥

You could head to the API tab and query data from this new API, but keep reading if you're using the docs sample app to
see the power of a unified schema by creating a relationship with our existing data model.

:::

## Step 3: Add a relationship

Click the `Data` tab at the top of the page, select the `Products` table from the left-hand side navigation, and click
`Relationships`. Scroll to the bottom of this page to find the `Remote Schema Relationships` and then click
`Add a remote schema relationship`:

  alt="API Explorer Landing Page"
  width="1146px"
/>

## Step 4: Configure the relationship

Call the relationship `countryInfo` and select `countries_api` from the `Remote Schema` dropdown.

Then, under `Configuration`, check `countries`. Nested within `countries`, check the `filter` option and select `code`,
then `eq`. We'll use the `country_of_origin` column as the foreign key for this relationship. When you've completed
these steps, scroll down and click `Save`.

## Step 5: Test it out

Head to the `API` tab and try this query; you should see a response similar to this:

<GraphiQLIDE
  query={`query {
  products {
		id
		name
    countryInfo {
      emoji
    }
  }
}`}
  response={`{
  "data": {
    "products": [
      {
        "id": "7992fdfa-65b5-11ed-8612-6a8b11ef7372",
        "name": "The Original Tee",
        "country_of_origin": "US",
        "countryInfo": [
          {
            "emoji": "ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "id": "8aa93f86-65b6-11ed-901c-f320d4e17bb2",
        "name": "Dark Furry Logo Tee",
        "country_of_origin": "US",
        "countryInfo": [
          {
            "emoji": "ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "id": "a44eda7c-65b6-11ed-997b-53b5bdb7117e",
        "name": "Hasuras in The Cloud Tee",
        "country_of_origin": "US",
        "countryInfo": [
          {
            "emoji": "ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "id": "cd6be51c-65b6-11ed-a2f4-4b71f0d3d70f",
        "name": "Get Ship Done Mug",
        "country_of_origin": "GB",
        "countryInfo": [
          {
            "emoji": "ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "id": "e0a70b16-65b6-11ed-8788-8fa2504d64a3",
        "name": "Sticker Sheet",
        "country_of_origin": "IN",
        "countryInfo": [
          {
            "emoji": "ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "id": "fef9c02c-65b6-11ed-be19-2b4fad811971",
        "name": "Monogram Baseball Cap",
        "country_of_origin": "AU",
        "countryInfo": [
          {
            "emoji": "ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}`}
/>

Since our `products` table has a `country_of_origin` field, each product has a country code as its value. We can use
this to filter by this value and return the data we want - in this case, a flag emoji - for our front end.

## Recap

What did we just do? Well, you just connected a remote GraphQL API to your Hasura GraphQL API and created a
[relationship between your existing data model and the new API](/data-federation/data-federation-types.mdx#database-to-remote-schema-relationships).
This means you can query data from both APIs in a single query, and also use the data from the remote API to filter or
augment your existing data model ðŸŽ‰

In our example, we used the data from the remote API to filter our existing data model by a country code, and then
return the data we want for that country. Common use cases include filtering for an id or a name.

All Hasura needs is a GraphQL endpoint to connect to, and it will automatically generate a GraphQL schema for you. This
means you can connect to any GraphQL API - or even multiple APIs - and access all your data in a single query from your
Hasura GraphQL API.
