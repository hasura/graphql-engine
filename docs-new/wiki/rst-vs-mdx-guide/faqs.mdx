<summary>How to control sidebar label & items order?</summary>

**For Individual Files**
Make use of `sidebar_label` and `sidebar_position` meta

```markdown
---
sidebar_label: Hasura Core
sidebar_position: 3
---
```

**For Directories (Categories)**
Please add a `_category_.json` and add the `label` and `position` properties.

```json
{
  "label": "Hasura Core",
  "position": 1
}
```

<summary>index file routes are resolved to `directory/` and not `directory/index`</summary>

Use `slug` metadata to manually set the slug to `directory/index`. Please check [this PR on docusaurus](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/5830) for more information.

```markdown title="index.mdx"
---
...
slug: /rst-vs-mdx-guide/index
---
```

<summary>A directory is not visible in sidebar when only index.mdx file exists</summary>

This is known and default behavior from docusaurus. `index` is considered direct link to directory index and won't be visible unless there is one more file.

To fix, rename the file from `index.mdx` to `directory-name.mdx` and remove the directory.

:::caution Wait, There are other files. But, not migrated yet!

In this case, migrate the non-index file first so that directory shows up and continue migrating index file.
