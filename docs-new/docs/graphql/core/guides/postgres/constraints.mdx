# Postgres constraints

## Introduction

[Postgres constraints](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-constraints.html)
are used to define rules for columns in a database table. They ensure
that no invalid data is entered into the database.

:::info Note

For more detailed information on Postgres constraints, please refer to
the [Postgres documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-constraints.html).

## Postgres constraints

There are different types of constraints that can be used with Postgres.

### Primary key constraints

A `PRIMARY KEY` is used to identify each row of a table uniquely.

**Identify the author's id as the primary key of the authors table:**

```sql {2}
CREATE TABLE authors(
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name           TEXT    NOT NULL
);
```

### Foreign key constraints

A foreign key constraint specifies that the values in a column must
match the values appearing in a row of another table. Foreign key
constraints are used to create relationships between tables.

**Define the author_id in the articles table as a foreign key to the id
column in the authors table:**

```sql {11}
CREATE TABLE authors(
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name           TEXT    NOT NULL,
  email          TEXT    UNIQUE
);

CREATE TABLE articles(
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  title          TEXT    NOT NULL,
  author_id INTEGER,
  FOREIGN KEY (author_id) REFERENCES authors (id)
);
```

### Not-null constraints

A not-null constraint allows you to specify that a column's value cannot
be `null`.

**Validate that an author's name cannot be null:**

```sql {2,3}
CREATE TABLE authors(
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name           TEXT    NOT NULL
);
```

### Unique constraints

Unique constraints prevent database entries with a duplicate value of
the respective column.

**Validate that an author's email is unique:**

```sql {4}
CREATE TABLE authors(
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name           TEXT    NOT NULL,
  email          TEXT    UNIQUE
);
```

### Check constraints

Check constraints allow you to specify a `Boolean` expression for one or
several columns. This Boolean expression must be satisfied (equal to
`true`) by the column value for the object to be inserted.

**Validate that an author's rating is between 1 and 10:**

```sql {4}
CREATE TABLE authors(
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name           TEXT    NOT NULL,
  rating         INT     NOT NULL CHECK(rating > 0 AND rating <= 10)
);
```

## Postgres constraints & Hasura

Most Postgres constraints (primary key, foreign key, not-null and unique
constraints) can be added to Hasura natively when
[creating tables](/graphql/core/databases/postgres/schema/tables.mdx#pg-create-tables).

Postgres check constraints can be used as a form of data validation in
Hasura and can be added
[as described here](/graphql/core/databases/postgres/schema/data-validations.mdx#pg-data-validations-check-constraints).
