# HTTP Compression

The Hasura GraphQL Engine supports HTTP compression. The server looks
for the `Accept-Encoding` header in request. If the header contains
`gzip` then the server uses [Gzip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gzip)
compression. Also, the server sets the `Content-Encoding` response
header value to `gzip`.

**Only responses from "/v2/query" and "/v1/graphql" endpoints are
compressed.**
