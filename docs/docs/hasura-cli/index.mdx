# Hasura CLI

## Introduction

The Hasura CLI is a command-line tool you can use to manage your Hasura instances.

We offer two primary methods for working with your Hasura instances: the Hasura Console and the Hasura CLI. While the
Console is robust and provides an easy-to-navigate GUI for interacting with your project, the CLI offers a more powerful
interface for managing your project.

The CLI is useful for:

- [managing Metadata](/migrations-metadata-seeds/manage-metadata.mdx).
- [creating and applying Migrations](/migrations-metadata-seeds/manage-migrations.mdx).
- integrating with your CI/CD pipeline.
- automating tasks.

You can use the CLI to initialize a new Hasura project from the very beginning, or you can use it to manage an
existing one.

## Installation

Installation is quick and easy with npm:

```bash
npm install -g hasura-cli
```

Or, if you prefer to install the binaries, check out our [installation guide](/hasura-cli/install-hasura-cli.mdx).

## Usage

The CLI has a number of commands you can use to manage your project. You can see the full list of commands by running:
`hasura --help`.

There are many subcommands too; you can see the available subcommands and their arguments by running a command with the
`--help` flag, for example: `hasura metadata --help`.

After installing, we suggest getting started by heading to the [CLI commands reference](/hasura-cli/commands/index.mdx).
