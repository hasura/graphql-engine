# Access control basics

## Introduction

To understand the basics of access control in Hasura, let's take a look
at this analogy to a SQL query:

<Thumbnail

  alt="Understanding access control in Hasura"
  width="700px"
/>

This query returns the right set of results by defining the requirements
for columns and rows in a given table. Hasura's rule-based access
control works similarly - you define the following permissions for a
combination of **role**, **table**, and **action** (*insert, update, select and delete*):

**Row-level permissions**

Limit access to a subset of the rows in the table based on this permission. Row-level permissions are
essentially boolean expressions that; when evaluated against any row determine access to it. These
permissions are constructed from the values in columns, [session variables](/graphql/core/auth/authorization/roles-variables.mdx) and
static values to build this boolean expression.

**Column-level permissions**

For the rows that are accessible based on the above, limit access to a
subset of the columns based on this permission rule.

## Example

Let's see access control in action using a simple example.

### Create a table

Head to your console and [create a table](/graphql/core/databases/postgres/schema/tables.mdx#pg-create-tables) called
`authors` with the following schema:

```sql
authors (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT
)
```

Now, insert some sample data into the table using the `Insert Row` tab
of the `authors` table.

### Run a query **without** access control

Head to the `API` tab in your console and try out the below query:

```graphql
query {
  authors {
    id
    name
  }
}
```

The response of the above query contains all the authors as, by default, the GraphQL query runs with **admin** permissions.

### Define access control rules

Now let's define an access control rule for the `authors` table for a role `user`.

<Tabs className="api-tabs">
<TabItem value="console" label="Console">

Head to the **Permissions** section of the table
(`Data -> [table] -> Permissions` tab) and define permissions as shown below:

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/graphql/core/auth/permission-basics-simple-example.png"
  alt="Define access control rules"
  width="1100px"
/>

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

You can add permissions in the `tables.yaml` file inside the `metadata` directory:

```yaml {4-12}
- table:
    schema: public
    name: authors
  select_permissions:
  - role: user
    permission:
      columns:
      - id
      - name
      filter:
        id:
          _eq: X-Hasura-User-Id
```

Apply the metadata by running:

```bash
hasura metadata apply
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="api" label="API">

You can add select permissions by using the [pg_create_select_permission metadata API](/graphql/core/api-reference/metadata-api/permission.mdx#metadata-pg-create-select-permission):

```http
POST /v1/metadata HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
X-Hasura-Role: admin

{
    "type" : "pg_create_select_permission",
    "args" : {
        "source": "<db_name>",
        "table" : "authors",
        "role" : "user",
        "permission" : {
            "columns" : [
              "id",
              "name"
            ],
            "filter" : {
                "id" : "X-Hasura-User-Id"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

This permission rule reads as: "*For the role* `user` *, table* `authors` *and operation* `select`/`query`,
allow access to those rows where the value in the `id` *column is the same as the value in the* `X-Hasura-User-ID` *session variable*".

### Run a query **with** access control

Let's run the same query as above but now with the `X-Hasura-Role` and `X-Hasura-User-ID` session variables also included to indicate role and user information.
These session variables are passed in the `Request Headers` section of `GraphiQL` as highlighted below:

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/graphql/core/auth/permission-basics-query-with-access-control.png"
  alt="Run a query with access control"
  width="1200px"
/>

As you can see, the results are now filtered based on the access control rule for the role `user`
(*since that is the role indicated by the* `X-Hasura-Role` *session variable*) and
the results are restricted to only those rows where the value in the `id` column is equal to `3`
(*as indicated by the* `X-Hasura-User-ID` *session variable*).


As described in the [Introduction to Authentication and Authorization](/graphql/core/auth/authorization/index.mdx)
section of the docs, your auth service is required to resolve authentication tokens into these session variables.
