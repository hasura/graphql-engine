## Introduction

[Distributed traces](/observability/tracing.mdx) track and map journeys of user requests across various services or
components which can then be analyzed via observability tools.

Traces are typically used to diagnose or debug which part of your application could potentially be responsible for a
failure or error state and to monitor the performance of end-user interactions with your application.

Traces are generated by instrumenting application code. Hasura has instrumented all API queries, mutations and
subscriptions with the [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/signals/traces/) format. These traces can
be exported directly from your Hasura instances to your observability tool that supports OpenTelemetry traces. This can
be configured in the `Settings` section of the Hasura Console.

:::info Support for metrics and logs

Currently, the OpenTelemetry Integration exports only traces. The support for metrics and logs will be added in the
future.

:::

## Configure the OpenTelemetry receiver

:::info Supported from

OpenTelemetry traces are supported for Hasura GraphQL Engine versions `v2.18.0` and above.

## Parameters

The following parameters are needed to set up the integration with your observability tool:

### Endpoint

The OpenTelemetry compliant receiver endpoint. The URL scheme (`http` or `https`) determines if SSL(TLS) should be used
for the communication. Please check the documentation for your observability tool to determine how to set up an
OpenTelemetry endpoint. There may be different endpoints provided for the `HTTP` and `gRPC` protocols (`gRPC` is not
supported yet), so ensure that you use the appropriate endpoint for your chosen connection type.

#### Endpoint Notes

- You may have to append `/v1/traces` to the end of the receiver endpoint URL if the provided URL does not contain this
  already. This depends on the observability vendor.
- If you are running Hasura as a Docker container without host networking enabled, and want to connect to a local
  [OpenTelemetry Collector](#opentelemetry-collector), you may want to use this as the endpoint:
  `http://host.docker.internal:4318/v1/traces`.
- If the `https` endpoint uses a custom or self-signed CA, add the endpoint to the
  [Insecure TLS Allow List](/deployment/tls-allow-list.mdx).

:::info OpenTelemetry Port Convention

It is a generally accepted convention that the OpenTelemetry receiver endpoint is exposed on port `4318` for HTTP but
can usually be customized. Please check the documentation for your observability tool to determine the port number.

:::

### Connection Type

The protocol and transport to be used for the communication with the receiver. Hasura currently only supports the
OpenTelemetry Protocol over HTTP (OTLP/HTTP with binary-encoded Protobuf payloads).

### Data Type

Selects the type of observability data points to be exported. `Traces` are the only data types that are currently
supported.

### Batch Size

Batch size is the maximum number of data points (spans in the context of traces) allowed per export request made to the
observability tool. Default size is 512.

### Headers

Headers are _(optionally)_ added to every request made by Hasura to the observability tool. They are generally
**Authorization/API keys** with the required role/permissions to accept OpenTelemetry data. Please refer to the
documentation in your observability tool to understand how required request headers need to be formatted. You can use an
environment variable as a header value too. This is important for values which are sensitive.

:::info Apply environment variables first

If you use an environment variable as a header value, please make sure that it's applied to the Hasura Docker container
before starting the container.

:::

Example using Console:

  width="745px"
/>

### Attributes

[Resource](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/reference/specification/overview/#resources) attributes are _(optional)_ custom
tags that are sent alongside observability data in order to identify the entity for which the observability data was
recorded. This is usually used to identify sources in a distributed tracing environment and aids in granular filtering
and analytics.

Example using Console:

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/enterprise/open-telemetry-headers_config-ui-attributes_2-18.png"
  alt="OpenTelemetry Attributes Console Configuration"
  width="745px"
/>

Your observability tool may expect to receive certain resource attributes in order to provide full functionality; such
resource attributes must be set with this parameter. Many, but not all, of these resource attributes will be
[OpenTelemetry Semantic Conventions](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/semantic-conventions/).

Hasura automatically sets some resource attributes. The values of such attributes can be overridden by specifying your
own value for the attribute using this parameter.

#### Default resource attributes

| Attribute                                                                                                    | Type   | Default  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------ | -------- |
| [service.name](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/reference/specification/resource/semantic_conventions/#service) | string | `hasura` |

:::info Attribute type support

Hasura currently only supports string-valued attributes.

## Consuming and visualizing traces

You can utilize your observability tool's UI to visualize and perform further analytics on trace data to monitor,
diagnose and troubleshoot your application. Typically, traces and their spans are listed out and selecting a trace shows
a flame graph containing a visual representation of where the operation spent its execution time. Below, we provide some
examples of how to consume and visualize traces using popular observability tools.

### Jaeger

To use [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/), simply add this to your `docker-compose.yaml`:

```yaml
jaeger:
  image: jaegertracing/all-in-one:1.37
  restart: always
  ports:
    - 5775:5775/udp
    - 6831:6831/udp
    - 6832:6832/udp
    - 5778:5778
    - 4002:16686
    - 14250:14250
    - 14268:14268
    - 14269:14269
    - 4317:4317 # OTLP gRPC
    - 4318:4318 # OTLP HTTP
    - 9411:9411
  environment:
    COLLECTOR_OTLP_ENABLED: 'true'
    COLLECTOR_ZIPKIN_HOST_PORT: '9411'
```

The image below shows a flame graph in Jaeger where a query took 5.64 milliseconds in total, of which 2.78 milliseconds
was the actual Postgres database processing the query.

### OpenTelemetry Collector

OpenTelemetry provides the [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/) that can export
OpenTelemetry data to observability tools that do not support native OpenTelemetry ingestion.

To work with such observability tools, Hasura's OpenTelemetry integration can be configured to send OpenTelemetry data
to the collector.

:::info Note

This collector should be run in your infrastructure and should be reachable by the Hasura backend that is configured to
send the data to it. The list of
[supported exporter targets](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/exporter) can
be found in the [OpenTelemetry Collector repository](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib).
