# Deployment regions

## Introduction

You can deploy Hasura Cloud projects in one of the supported regions (more regions are coming soon). A project's region
of deployment can be selected while creating the project and it can be changed later from the project details.

## Selecting the region while creating a project

Click on the `New Project` button on the project-list page. You can select the project's region of deployment from the
`Select a region` dropdown.

## Changing region of an existing project

Go the the project details by clicking on the settings icon on your project card in the project list.

The `Region` field displays the project's current region of deployment. For switching the region, click on the edit icon
in the `Region` field.

There might be a short downtime while your project is being moved to a different region. If your database allows
connections only from specific IP addresses, make sure you add the Hasura Cloud IP of this new region to the list of
allowed IP addresses.

Choose a region of your choice and hit `Save`.
