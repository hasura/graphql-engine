  USAGE: $0 (--normalize | --all | [--target <package_name> <package_version>]...)

This script is to help updating the freeze file to bring in newer versions of
dependencies. It takes care of a few gotchas and footguns for you (see source).

The simplest mode, when called with '--normalize', will reuse the existing
constraints and just re-freeze, to make sure the file doesn't have extra or
missing information.

When called with '--all', it removes all existing constraints, finds a brand
new build plan, and freezes it.

Instead if you want to upgrade one or more particular packages, while keeping
as many of the other dependencies the same as possible, you can use '--target
foo 1.2.3.4'. This may take a bit of time, and might fail to find a plan,
especially if you pass more than one target.

### Finally do a little cleanup/normalizing:

# Remove graphql engine internal mono-repo packages. This doesn't matter unless
# we happen to bump the version number in one of our cabal files.
sed -ri "/\s+graphql-engine/d" "$FREEZE_FILE"
# Remove all flags from the freeze file. By default cabal bakes in the default
# flags for a library; This makes it very difficult to review the freeze file
# to determine where we might be either intentionally or unintentionally
# overriding default flags, and it's easy for flags from a local developerâ€™s
# environment to get accidentally committed. This is checked in CI.  For
# discussion, see:
#   https://hasurahq.slack.com/archives/CV3UR1MT2/p1654544760362949
#   https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine-mono/pull/4618
sed -ri "/\s+\S+ [+-]/d" "$FREEZE_FILE"

echo_pretty "Success!(?) Be sure to check that we were actually able to get a plan with package versions you hoped for"
