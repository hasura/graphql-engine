# Quickstart with Kubernetes

<div className='badge badge--primary heading-badge'>Available on: Enterprise Edition</div>

## Introduction

This tutorial helps you set up Hasura Enterprise Edition on Kubernetes and connect it to your Postgres database.

**This guide requires HGE versions `v2.12.0` and above.** Installation instructions are below.

## Deploying Hasura EE on Kubernetes

### Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes that the following prerequisites have been met:

- A functioning Kubernetes cluster.
- This tutorial uses a container image hosted on the public Docker hub, so your Kubernetes cluster must have internet
  access.
- You have a Postgres database for storing metadata and Redis for caching / rate limiting, preferably a managed service.
- The latest version of [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl) compatible with your cluster has been
  installed and configured.

### Step 1: Get the Kubernetes deployment and service files

The [install manifests repo](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/tree/master/install-manifests) contains all
installation manifests required to deploy Hasura anywhere. Get the Kubernetes deployment and service files from there:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hasura/graphql-engine/stable/install-manifests/enterprise/kubernetes/deployment.yaml
```

### Step 2: Set the license key, metadata database URL, Redis database URL and the admin secret

Edit `deployment.yaml` and set the right values:

```yaml {4,6,8,10,12}
---
env:
  - name: HASURA_GRAPHQL_EE_LICENSE_KEY
    value: ''
  - name: HASURA_GRAPHQL_METADATA_DATABASE_URL
    value: postgres://<username>:<password>@hostname:<port>/<dbname>
  - name: HASURA_GRAPHQL_REDIS_URL
    value: redis://redis:6379
  - name: HASURA_GRAPHQL_RATE_LIMIT_REDIS_URL
    value: redis://redis:6379
  - name: HASURA_GRAPHQL_ADMIN_SECRET
    value: adminsecret
```

Examples of `HASURA_GRAPHQL_METADATA_DATABASE_URL`:

- `postgres://admin:password@postgres:5432/my_db`
- `postgres://admin:@postgres:5432/my_db` _(if there is no password)_

Examples of `HASURA_GRAPHQL_REDIS_URL` and `HASURA_GRAPHQL_RATE_LIMIT_REDIS_URL`:

- `redis://admin:password@redis:6379`
- `redis://redis:6379` _(if there is no password)_

:::info Note

- If your **password contains special characters** (e.g. #, %, $, @, etc.), you need to URL encode them in the
  `HASURA_GRAPHQL_METADATA_DATABASE_URL` env var (e.g. %40 for @).

  You can check the [logs](#kubernetes-logs) to see if the database credentials are proper and if Hasura is able to
  connect to the database.

- The Hasura GraphQL engine needs access permissions on your Postgres database as described in
  [Postgres permissions](/deployment/postgres-requirements.mdx#postgres-permissions).

- The `HASURA_GRAPHQL_ADMIN_SECRET` should never be passed from the client to the Hasura GraphQL engine as it would give
  the client full admin rights to your Hasura instance. See [Authentication & Authorization](/auth/index.mdx) for
  information on setting up authentication.

- Move confidential environment variables such as Postgres / Redis URLs, admin / metrics secrets to fetch from
  kubernetes secrets / vault / your preferred approach.

:::

### Step 3: Create the Kubernetes deployment and service

```bash
kubectl create -f deployment.yaml
```

### Step 4: Open the Hasura console

The above creates a LoadBalancer type service with port 80. So you should be able to access the console at the external
IP.

For example, using Docker-for-desktop on Mac:

```bash
kubectl get svc
NAME         TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
hasura       LoadBalancer   10.96.214.240   localhost     80:30303/TCP   4m
kubernetes   ClusterIP      10.96.0.1       <none>        443/TCP        8m
```

Head to: `http://localhost` and the console should load!

### Step 5: Start using Hasura

Congratulations! You have successfully set up Hasura EE on Docker.

## Hasura GraphQL engine server logs {#kubernetes-logs}

You can check the logs of the Hasura GraphQL engine deployed on Kubernetes by checking the logs of the GraphQL engine
service, i.e. `hasura`:

```bash
kubectl logs -f svc/hasura

{"timestamp":"2018-10-09T11:20:32.054+0000", "level":"info", "type":"http-log", "detail":{"status":200, "query_hash":"01640c6dd131826cff44308111ed40d7fbd1cbed", "http_version":"HTTP/1.1", "query_execution_time":3.0177627e-2, "request_id":null, "url":"/v1/graphql", "user":{"x-hasura-role":"admin"}, "ip":"127.0.0.1", "response_size":209329, "method":"POST", "detail":null}}
...
```

**See:**

- [Kubernetes logs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/logging) for more details on logging in
  Kubernetes.
- [Hasura GraphQL engine logs](/deployment/logging.mdx) for more details on Hasura logs.

## Updating Hasura GraphQL engine {#kubernetes-update}

This guide will help you update the Hasura GraphQL engine running on Kubernetes. This guide assumes that you already
have the Hasura GraphQL engine running on Kubernetes.

### Step 1: Check the latest release version

The current latest version is:

<code>
  hasura/graphql-engine:
  <LatestRelease />
</code>

All the versions can be found [here](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/releases).

### Step 2: Update the container image

In the `deployment.yaml` file, update the image tag to this latest version.

For example, if you had:

```yaml
containers:
  - image: hasura/graphql-engine:v1.0.0-alpha01
```

you should change it to:

<pre>
  <code>
    containers:
    <br />
    {'  '}- image: hasura/graphql-engine:
    <LatestRelease />
  </code>
</pre>

### Step 3: Roll out the change

```bash
kubectl replace -f deployment.yaml
```

:::info Note

If you are downgrading to an older version of the GraphQL engine, you might need to downgrade your metadata catalogue
version as described in [Downgrading Hasura GraphQL engine](/deployment/downgrading.mdx).
