# Console SSO with Auth0

<div className="badge badge--primary heading-badge">Available on: Self-hosted Enterprise</div>

## Introduction

Auth0 is a rapidly integrable authentication and authorization service. You can use it easily to manage admin users,
integrate SSO with Hasura GraphQL Engine or act as middleware to connect non-OAuth compliant identity providers (IdP).

This guide assumes you have a Hasura GraphQL Engine instance running with a valid license key. If you don't have one,
you can get a license key via a [30-day free trial](/enterprise/try-hasura-enterprise-edition.mdx) or by contacting the
[Hasura team](mailto:sales@hasura.io).

:::info Supported from

SSO for LDAP is supported from versions `v2.25.0` and above.

:::

## Get started

You can try the SSO configuration with [this demo](https://github.com/hasura/ee-sso-demo). The demo uses
[OpenLDAP](https://www.openldap.org/) to integrate with Dex. You can clone the repository, edit the EE License Key
environment variable, and start up Docker Compose services.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hasura/ee-sso-demo.git
cd ee-sso-demo
cp dotenv .env
docker-compose up -d
```

Finally, browse `http://localhost:8080` and try the SSO login.

## OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect

### Step 1: Configure Auth0

After creating an Auth0 application, go to the Settings tab and configure:

- Application URIs:
  - Set `Allowed Callback URLs` to match the callback URL of the Hasura Console, e.g
    `http://localhost:8080/console/oauth2/callback`
  - Set `Allowed Web Origins` to match the origin of the Hasura Console, e.g `http://localhost:8080`
- Cross-Origin Authentication:
  - Enable the `Allow Cross-Origin Authentication` setting.
  - Set `Allowed Origins (CORS)` to match the origin of the Hasura Console, e.g: `http://localhost:8080`
- Open the `Advanced Settings` accordion at the bottom:
  - Switch to the tab `Grant Types` and enable the `Authorization Code` checkbox.
  - Switch to the `Endpoints` tab and note down required configuration values for Hasura SSO:
    - `authorization_url`: OAuth Authorization URL
    - `request_token_url`: OAuth Token URL
    - `jwt_secret.jwk_url`: JSON Web Key Set

Save changes and note the Client ID in the `Basic Information` section. We'll need this later.

By default, OAuth0 doesn't include the role value in JWT claims. We need to either:

- Force the `admin` role to the `jwt_secret.claims_map` mappings field in the `HASURA_GRAPHQL_SSO_PROVIDERS`
  configuration:

```json
{
  "jwt_secret": {
    // ...
    "claims_map": {
      "x-hasura-allowed-roles": ["admin"],
      "x-hasura-default-role": "admin"
    }
  }
}
```

- Or, add an Auth0 action or legacy Auth pipeline to add the role claim into the JWT payload.

For better security, or if your Auth0 application is reused for many different client applications, you should create an
admin role for the privileged user and add the role to JWT claims:

- Go to the `User Management -> Roles` page, and create a new role with the name `admin`.
- Assign some users with that role to verify later.
- Go to the `Actions -> Flows` page, choose the `Login` flow, and add a custom action to add claims.

```typescript
/**
 * Handler that will be called during the execution of a PostLogin flow.
 *
 * @param {Event} event - Details about the user and the context in which they are logging in.
 * @param {PostLoginAPI} api - Interface whose methods can be used to change the behavior of the login.
 */
exports.onExecutePostLogin = async (event, api) => {
  const namespace = 'https://hasura.io/jwt/claims';
  if (event.authorization) {
    const claims = {
      'x-hasura-default-role': event.authorization.roles[0],
      'x-hasura-allowed-roles': event.authorization.roles,
      'x-hasura-user-id': event.user.user_id,
    };
    api.idToken.setCustomClaim(namespace, claims);
  }
};
```

- Deploy the action.
- Head back to the flow and drag the custom action to the center of the flow diagram.

### Step 2: Configure Hasura

The table below describes the configuration options for Auth0 SSO. Hasura GraphQL Engine will expect these values to be
set as the value of the
[`HASURA_GRAPHQL_SSO_PROVIDERS`](/deployment/graphql-engine-flags/reference.mdx/#single-sign-on-providers) environment
variable:

| Key                  | Example                                | Description                                                                                         |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `client_id`          | `<client-id>`                          | The Client ID of Auth0 application                                                                  |
| `admin_roles`        | `["admin"]`                            | X-hasura-roles that should be given admin access to Console                                         |
| `name`               | Auth0 Login                            | A display name for this login method on the Console                                                 |
| `authorization_url`  | `<OAuth Authorization URL>`            | Endpoint of Auth0 application for auth request, should be reachable from browser                    |
| `request_token_url`  | `<OAuth Token URL>`                    | Endpoint of Auth0 application for token request, should be reachable from browser                   |
| `scope`              | `openid`                               | Oauth2 scopes to be used against Auth0 application                                                  |
| `jwt_secret.type`    | `RS256`                                | Key type Auth0 application is configured with                                                       |
| `jwt_secret.jwk_url` | `<JSON Web Key Set>`                   | JWK URL that is published by Auth0 application                                                      |
| `jwt_secret.issuer`  | `https://some-auth0-app.us.auth0.com/` | Issuer that is configured with Auth0, this is typically the base OAuth URL of the Auth0 application |

Using the information above as an example, you can configure the `HASURA_GRAPHQL_SSO_PROVIDERS` environment variable as
follows:

```json
[
  {
    "client_id": "<Auth0 Client ID>",
    "admin_roles": ["admin"],
    "name": "Auth0 Login",
    "authorization_url": "https://some-auth0-app.us.auth0.com/authorize",
    "request_token_url": "https://some-auth0-app.us.auth0.com/oauth/token",
    "scope": "openid",
    "jwt_secret": {
      "type": "RS256",
      "jwk_url": "https://some-auth0-app.us.auth0.com/.well-known/jwks.json",
      "issuer": "https://some-auth0-app.us.auth0.com/"
    }
  }
]
```

:::info Setting environment variables

For guidance on setting environment variables or flags for Hasura GraphQL Engine, see
[server configuration](/deployment/graphql-engine-flags/index.mdx).

:::

### Step 3: Deploy and Log in

At this point, you should see a `Auth0 Login` option on the Hasura Console. Now, you're ready to log in with your Auth0
account ðŸŽ‰

<Thumbnail src="/img/enterprise/sso-animated-demo.gif" alt="Console SSO demo" />

## SAML

The Auth0 application also supports SAML 2.0. Though, the OAuth configuration is simpler to integrate. You can try it to
verify with Dex integration.

### Step 1: Configure Auth0

The configuration is similar to the [OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect](#step-1-configure-auth0) with some extra
configurations:

- Go to `Application -> Addons tab` and enable the `SAML2 WEB APP` plugin.
- The `Settings` dialog will be opened. You need to add the Dex endpoint into `Application Callback URL` textbox (e.g.,
  `http://localhost:5556/dex/callback`).
- After saving, switch to the `Usage` tab and note down required values for Dex connector configuration:
  - The SSO URL (Identity Provider Login URL).
  - Issuer: `urn:some-auth0-app.us.auth0.com`.
  - Download Auth0 certificate (Identity Provider Certificate) to the configuration folder of Dex.

Auth0 doesn't include roles in attributes of the XML response either. We need to add the `roles` field to custom claims.

```typescript
/**
 * Handler that will be called during the execution of a PostLogin flow.
 *
 * @param {Event} event - Details about the user and the context in which they are logging in.
 * @param {PostLoginAPI} api - Interface whose methods can be used to change the behavior of the login.
 */
exports.onExecutePostLogin = async (event, api) => {
    api.idToken.setCustomClaim('roles', event.authorization.roles);
  }
};
```

Auth0 automatically serializes custom claims into XML attributes with the `http://schemas.auth0.com/` prefix (e.g.,
`http://schemas.auth0.com/roles`).

### Step 2: Configure Hasura

The table below describes the configuration options for Auth0 SAML SSO. Hasura GraphQL Engine will expect these values
to be set as the value of the
[`HASURA_GRAPHQL_SSO_PROVIDERS`](/deployment/graphql-engine-flags/reference.mdx/#single-sign-on-providers) environment
variable:

| Key                     | Example                                                                                             | Description                                                                                                                            |

| `admin_roles`           | `["admin"]`                                                                                         | X-hasura-roles that should be given admin access to Console                                                                            |

| `authorization_url`     | `http://dex-endpoint-from-browser:port/dex/auth`                                                    | Endpoint of Dex for auth request, should be reachable from browser                                                                     |

| `jwt_secret.jwk_url`    | `http://dex-endpoint-from-hasura:port/dex/keys`                                                     | JWK URL that is published by dex                                                                                                       |
| `jwt_secret.issuer`     | `http://dex-endpoint-from-browser:port/dex`                                                         | Issuer that is configured with Dex, same as issuer in Dex configuration, this is typically the endpoint at which Dex can be reached at |
| `jwt_secret.claims_map` | `{"x-hasura-allowed-roles": {"path": "$.groups"},"x-hasura-default-role": {"path": "$.groups[0]"}}` | Mapping groups parsed by Dex to roles on Hasura                                                                                        |

Using the information above as an example, you can configure the `HASURA_GRAPHQL_SSO_PROVIDERS` environment variable as
follows:

```json
[
  {
    "client_id": "dex-login",
    "admin_roles": ["admin", "admins"],
    "name": "Dex Login",
    "authorization_url": "http://localhost:5556/dex/auth",
    "request_token_url": "http://localhost:5556/dex/token",
    "scope": "openid offline_access groups",
    "jwt_secret": {
      "type": "RS256",
      "jwk_url": "http://dex:5556/dex/keys",

        },
        "x-hasura-default-role": {
          "path": "$.groups[0]"
        }
      }
    }
  }
]
```

:::info Setting environment variables

For guidance on setting environment variables or flags for Hasura GraphQL Engine, see
[server configuration](/deployment/graphql-engine-flags/index.mdx).

:::

### Step 3: Configure Dex

Your Dex configuration will need the following fields set to enable SAML SSO. You can find a sample configuration file
below. This file should be saved in the `/dex` directory of your container.

#### Issuer

The base path of Dex and the external name of the OpenID Connect service. This is the canonical URL that all clients
**must** use to refer to Dex. If a path is provided, Dex's HTTP service will listen at a non-root URL. This is the
public URL at which Dex is available.

Example:

```plaintext
http://dex-domain:5556/dex
```

#### Static clients

This contains the `id` and `redirectURIs`. The `id` will reference the `client_id` in the Hasura configuration. The
`redirectURIs` will be the oauth callback URL of Hasura Console, which is at
`http(s)://<hasura-endpoint>/console/oauth2/callback`.

Example:

```yaml
staticClients:
  - id: dex-login
    redirectURIs:
      - 'http://localhost:8080/console/oauth2/callback'
    name: 'Dex Login'
    public: true
```

#### Connectors

The connectors field is an array of objects that define the various connectors being used in the Dex configuration. Each
object in the array contains a `type` field that specifies the type of connector being used. Here, we'll use
`type: saml` along with a series of fields that are specific to the SAML connector.

```yaml
connectors:
  - type: saml
    id: saml-auth0
    name: Auth0 SAML
    config:
      ssoURL: https://some-auth0-app.us.auth0.com/samlp/xxxxxxxx
      ca: /etc/dex/saml-ca.pem
      # insecureSkipSignatureValidation: true
      redirectURI: http://localhost:5556/dex/callback
      usernameAttr: http://schemas.auth0.com/name
      emailAttr: http://schemas.auth0.com/email
      groupsAttr: http://schemas.auth0.com/roles
      entityIssuer: urn:some-auth0-app.us.auth0.com
```

### Step 4: Update your deployment

Finally, you'll need to configure your deployment with these changes. Here is a Docker Compose example, with the
configuration:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:15
    restart: always
    volumes:
