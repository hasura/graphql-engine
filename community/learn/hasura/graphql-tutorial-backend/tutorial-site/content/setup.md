Let's start by deploying Hasura.

## One-click deployment on Heroku

The fastest way to try Hasura out is via Heroku.

## Deploy
- Click on the following button to deploy GraphQL Engine on Heroku with the free Postgres add-on:

    [![Deploy to Heroku](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine-heroku)

    This will deploy Hasura GraphQL Engine on Heroku. A PostgreSQL database will be automatically provisioned along with Hasura. If you donâ€™t have an account on Heroku, you would be required to sign up. 
    *Note*: It is free to signup and no credit-card is required.

## Hasura Console
- Open the Hasura console

   Visit `https://<app-name>.herokuapp.com` (*replace \<app-name\> with your app name*) to open the admin console.

It should look something like this:
