Introduction
------------

This guide shows how to deploy the Hasura GraphQL engine on `Render <https://render.com>`__.

One-click Deploy on Render
--------------------------

.. note::
   Make sure to `create a free Render account <https://render.com/register>`__ first.

Once you're logged into your Render account, click the button below to deploy Hasura and a
new managed PostgreSQL database wired up to your Hasura instance.

That's it! Read on to configure your Hasura instance.

Access your Hasura Console
--------------------------

Once **Deploy to Render** succeeds, you can click through to your Hasura service page on Render's dashboard.

You can monitor the deployment of the Hasura web service from the **Logs** tab. Once the service is up, use the link on the service page to access your Hasura console:

.. code-block:: bash

   https://<your-hasura-slug>.onrender.com/

You can create tables and test your GraphQL queries here.
