# Hspec API Test Harness

The test harness provides convenience functions and infrastructure for writing
tests at the API level of `graphql-engine`. Specifically, it focuses on setup
and teardown for fixtures across our supported backends, and writing tests
against the GraphQL API.

## Setup

The harness depends on the values in `src/Harness/Constants.hs` being correct.
Running `docker-compose up` in the root of `graphql-engine` should take care of
this for everything except BigQuery. Because BigQuery doesn't have a way of
installing locally for testing, we have to connect to an actual BigQuery
account. To test against BigQuery, the following environment variables must be
set:

- `HASURA_BIGQUERY_SERVICE_KEY`: the service account key.
- `HASURA_BIGQUERY_PROJECT_ID`: the ID of a project on the service account.

Once the account has been verified, the service account email variable can be
omitted from subsequent test runs. For the first run, however:

1. Ensure you have access to a Google Cloud Console service account. Store the
   project ID and account email in `HASURA_BIGQUERY_PROJECT_ID` variable.

   ```bash
   $ export HASURA_BIGQUERY_PROJECT_ID=hasura-project-identifier
   ```

2. Create and download a new service account key. Store the contents of file in
   a `HASURA_BIGQUERY_SERVICE_KEY` variable.

   ```bash
   $ export HASURA_BIGQUERY_SERVICE_KEY=$(cat /path/to/service/account)
   ```

   https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys

3. Login and activate the service account if it is not already activated.

4. Verify the service account is accessible via the BigQuery API by setting the
   `HASURA_BIGQUERY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL` with the service account email and
   running the verification script.

   ```bash
   $ export HASURA_BIGQUERY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL=hasura@email.com
   $ ./scripts/verify-bigquery-creds.sh
   ```

   If the query succeeds, the service account is setup correctly to run tests
   against BigQuery locally!

_Note to Hasura team: a service account is already setup for internal use,
please check the wiki for further details._

## Logging

Currently, in order to enable logging, you have to edit the `engineLogLevel`
term in [Harness/Constants.hs](Harness/Constants.hs) manually and specify the
level of logging you want to display.

```diff
engineLogLevel :: Maybe L.LogLevel
- engineLogLevel = Nothing
+ engineLogLevel = Just L.LevelDebug -- Enable all logs
```

## Library Structure

### `Harness.Backend`

Utilies for interacting with all our specific backends. This includes functions
for checking liveness (is the database/backend running?), as well as setting up
fixtures (creating tables, inserting data, tracking them in Hasura, setting
permissions, and so on).

### `Harness.Quoter`

QuasiQuoters for writing non-Haskell languages such as YAML and GraphQL.

### `Harness.Test`

Specific functions for writing Hspec suites. This directory is probably best
understood starting with `Harness.Test.Fixture`, which describes the method for
running tests against one or more backends.

#### Setup / teardown actions

To ensure things are cleaned up properly in the event of errors in setting up
and tearing down tests, test setup is defined in terms of `SetupAction`s.

These look like this:

```haskell
data SetupAction = forall a.
  SetupAction
    { setupAction :: IO a,
      teardownAction :: Maybe a -> IO ()
    }
```

A `SetupAction` encodes how to setup and tear down a single piece of test
system state. The value produced by a `setupAction` is to be input into the
corresponding `teardownAction`, if the `setupAction` completed without throwing
an exception.

Therefore one `SetupAction` could create the DB tables, and the matching
teardown removes them. Pairing setup / teardown in this way makes it easier to
remove everything in the right order.

##### Setup

The setup actions are responsible for creating the environment for the test.
They need to, for example:

1. Clear and reconfigure the metadata
2. Setup tables and insert values
3. Track tables, add relationships, permissions

These actions can be created by running POST requests against graphql-engine
using `Harness.GraphqlEngine.post_`, or by running SQL requests against the
backend using `Backend.<backend>.run_`.

##### Teardown

These actions are responsible for freeing acquired resources, and reverting all
local modifications: dropping newly created tables, deleting custom functions,
removing the changes made to the metadata, and so on.

These actions can be created by running POST requests against graphql-engine
using `Harness.GraphqlEngine.post_`, or by running SQL requests against the
backend using `Backend.<backend>.run_`.
