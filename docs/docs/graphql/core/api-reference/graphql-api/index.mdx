# GraphQL API Reference

## Introduction

All GraphQL requests for queries, subscriptions and mutations are made
to the GraphQL API.

## Endpoint

All requests are `POST` requests to the `/v1/graphql` (or
`/v1alpha1/graphql`) endpoint.

:::info Note

The `/v1/graphql` endpoint returns HTTP 200 status codes for all
responses. This is a **breaking** change from the `/v1alpha1/graphql`
behaviour, where request errors and internal errors were responded with
4xx and 5xx status codes.

:::

## Request types

The following types of requests can be made using the GraphQL API:

- [Query / Subscription](/graphql/core/api-reference/graphql-api/query.mdx ) 
- [Mutation](/graphql/core/api-reference/graphql-api/mutation.mdx)


## Batching requests

The GraphQL API provides support for batched requests (which can be a
combination of queries and mutations). The endpoint will accept an array
of operations in place of a single operation, and return an array of
corresponding responses.

**Example:** using a client which supports batching (such as Apollo
Client), we can send two query operations in one request:

<GraphiQLIDE
  query={`query first {
  author(where: {id: {_eq: 1}}) {
    id
    name
  }
}
query second {
  author(where: {id: {_eq: 2}}) {
    id
    name
  }
}`}
response={`[
  {
    "data": {
      "author": [
        {
          "id": 1,
          "name": "Justin"
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  {
    "data": {
      "author": [
        {
          "id": 2,
          "name": "Beltran"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
]`}
/>
