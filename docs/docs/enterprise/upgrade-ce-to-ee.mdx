# Upgrading from Hasura CE to Hasura Enterprise

<ProductBadge self />

## Overview

Starting from Hasura GraphQL Engine version `v2.12.0`, we have included both open-source and commercial components in
the `hasura/graphql-engine` container image. The open-source portions are licensed under the [Apache License, Version 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0). The proprietary components include features for Hasura Enterprise and they can be enabled through a free trial or with a license key provided by the Hasura team.

:::info Note

If you would
like to use an image with only the open source components, please use Docker images on
[this page](https://hub.docker.com/r/hasura/graphql-engine/tags?page=1&name=-ce) that contain `-ce`. (example:
`hasura/graphql-engine:<VERSION>-ce`)
:::


#### Hasura Enterprise trial

If you're running Hasura version `v2.23.0` or greater, you can instantly try Hasura Enterprise on your existing Hasura setup by signing up for a [free 30-day Hasura Enterprise trial](/enterprise/try-hasura-enterprise-edition.mdx).

#### Hasura Enterprise Edition license key

If you have been provided a license key by the Hasura team, set it as the value for the `HASURA_GRAPHQL_EE_LICENSE_KEY` environment variable in your Hasura container.

E.g. if the license key sent by the Hasura team is `ABC1234`, you will set `HASURA_GRAPHQL_EE_LICENSE_KEY=”ABC1234”`.

Restart Hasura to start using the enteprise features.
