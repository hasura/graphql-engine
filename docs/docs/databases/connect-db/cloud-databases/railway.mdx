# Using Hasura Cloud with a Railway Postgres Database

<div className='badge badge--primary heading-badge'>Available on: Cloud</div>

## Introduction

This guide explains how to connect a new or existing Railway Postgres database to a Hasura Cloud project. If you're
exploring Railway Postgres and are interested in migrating an existing Postgres database - such as from Heroku - check
out their [docs](https://railway.app/heroku) before continuing below.

## Step 1: Sign up or log in to Hasura Cloud

Navigate to [Hasura Cloud](https://cloud.hasura.io/signup/?pg=docs&plcmt=body&cta=navigate-to-hasura-cloud&tech=default)
and sign up or log in.

## Step 2: Create a Hasura Cloud project {#create-hasura-project}

On the Hasura Cloud dashboard, create a new project:

<Thumbnail src='/img/cloud-dbs/create-hasura-cloud-project.png' alt='Create Hasura Cloud project' />

After the project is initialized successfully, click on `Launch Console` to open the Hasura Console in your browser.

On the Hasura Console, navigate to `Data -> Manage -> Connect Database -> Connect existing database`:

You will get prompted for a Postgres Database URL. We will create this in the next step and then come back here.

## Step 3: Create a Postgres DB on Railway ([skip if you have an existing DB](#get-db-url))

Log into [Railway](https://railway.app/dashboard).

From your dashboard, click `New Project`:

<Thumbnail src='/img/cloud-dbs/railway/railway-new-project.png' alt='Create a new project with Railway' width='700px' />

Select `Provision PostgreSQL`:

Railway will redirect you to the project's dashboard. After a few seconds, you should see the `Activity` card update
with information about your new instance. Congratulations! You've now created a Postgres instance on Railway which you
can use with Hasura GraphQL Engine. Follow the steps below to connect it to Hasura.

## Step 4: Get the database connection URL {#get-db-url}

The structure of the database connection URL looks as follows:

```bash
postgresql://<user-name>:<password>@<host-server>:<port>/<database-name>
```

Click on the `PostgreSQL` card to see details related to this instance.

  alt='Access your the details of the db from the card'

/>

Choose the `Connect` tab and copy the `Postgres Connection URL`:

<Thumbnail

  alt='Go to the connect tab and grab the connection string'
  width='700px'
/>

## Step 5: Finish connecting the database

Back on the Hasura Console, enter the database URL that we retrieved in the previous step:

<Thumbnail

  alt='Connect the database on Hasura Console'
  width='700px'
/>

Then click `Connect Database`.

:::info Note

For security reasons, it is recommended to set database URLs as
[env vars](/projects/env-vars.mdx#manage-project-env-vars) and using the env vars to connect to the databases in place
of the raw database URLs.

Voil√†. You are ready to start developing.

## Next steps

You can check out our [30-Minute Hasura Basics Course](https://hasura.io/learn/graphql/hasura/introduction/) and other
[GraphQL & Hasura Courses](https://hasura.io/learn/) for a more detailed introduction to Hasura.

You can also click the gear icon to manage your Hasura Cloud project. (e.g. add
[collaborators](/projects/collaborators.mdx#manage-project-collaborators),
[env vars](/projects/env-vars.mdx#manage-project-env-vars) or
[custom domains](/projects/domains.mdx#manage-project-domains)).
