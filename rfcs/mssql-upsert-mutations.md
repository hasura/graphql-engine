## User story

As a user, I would like to be able to upsert rows in from a certain mssql table using a predicate, similarly to how I'm able to do so for a postgres table.

Upserting rows into a table should be done via a GraphQL mutation to the `/v1/graphql` endpoint.

Upserts should respect:
- [row-level permissions](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/graphql/core/auth/authorization/permission-rules.html#row-level-permissions)
- [column-level permissions](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/graphql/core/auth/authorization/permission-rules.html#col-level-permissions)
- [role-based column presets](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/graphql/core/auth/authorization/permission-rules.html#col-presets-permissions)

| `mutation-response` | `true`   | [`mutation response`](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/graphql/core/api-reference/graphql-api/mutation.html#mutationresponse) | same as postgres                                                             |

#### `if_matched` argument
The `if_matched` clause is used to convert an insert mutation to an upsert mutation, similar to Postgres' `on_conflict` clause. Upsert respects the tableâ€™s update permissions before editing an existing row in case of a match. Hence the `if_matched` clause is permitted only if a table has update permissions defined.

```graphql
if_matched {
    # columns that are allowed to be selected
    # this determines the 'ON' expression
    match_columns: [table_select_column]

    # columns that can should be updated when  matched
    # (same as postgres' update_columns in on_conflict)
    update_columns: [table_update_column]

    # same as postgres, I think we can 'AND' this with
    # the 'ON' condition derived from 'match_columns'
    where: table_bool_exp
}
```

#### example
```graphql
mutation {
  insert_author(
    objects: { id: 1, name: "aaa" }
    if_matched: { match_columns: author_pkey, update_columns: name }
  ) {
    returning {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}

```

Comparable to the [Postgres insert/upsert API](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/graphql/core/api-reference/graphql-api/mutation.html#insert-upsert-syntax)

### Response

The mutation response is specified in the [GraphQL spec](https://spec.graphql.org/June2018/#sec-Mutation), including:

```graphql
{ data # the returned data is specified by the `mutation-response` section
    {
    affected_rows
    returning { # the `returning` statement can include nested objects
        response-field1
        response-field2
        ..
    }
    }
}
```

...or, in the event of an unsuccessful mutation:

```graphql
{ errors {
    extensions
    message
  }
}
```

## Success

<!-- How do we know if we've solved this problem?

This could include a specific list of acceptance criteria.

This could outline specific edge cases that need to be handled.

This section should be more high-level, with more detail added in the subsequent **What** section. -->
- [TestGraphqlInsertOnConflict](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine-mono/blob/936f138c80d7a928180e6e7b0c4da64ecc1f7ebc/server/tests-py/test_graphql_mutations.py#L115) tests pass for MSSQL, demonstrating:
  - simple upsert: `test_on_conflict_update`
  - upsert with filter: `test_order_on_conflict_where`
  - upsert request ignored: `test_on_conflict_ignore`
  - consider renaming "on conflict" tests to refer to something more backend-agnostic like "upserts".
- [ ] TODO [Vamshi](https://github.com/0x777) will write a description [like this](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine-mono/pull/2403#issuecomment-933630333) to retroactively refine the acceptance criteria, and propose a minimal set of tests for upserts to replace the ones above. However, this shouldn't block implementation.
- upserts are executable via the console and CLI.
- users can define row-level and column-level permissions for upserts via the console and CLI
- upserts on SQL Server are documented in Hasura docs. The [existing Postgres docs](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/graphql/core/databases/postgres/mutations/upsert.html) can be used as a guide.

## Design

### 1. Cleanup `XOnConflict` and `ExtraInsertData`

The way we have been using the `XFeatureFlag` trick is something of an anti-pattern.

Differences in behavior across backends should not manifest itself as "case switching" in shared code (be that at runtime or compile-time case-switching). Rather, they should happen in the type class instance declarations, and code sharing should be achieved via shared building blocks that individual backends may put together in ways appropriate to them, in a similar fashion to how #2741 does for `updateOperators`.

Currently, the main thing that `type XOnConflict b :: *` achieves is that it lets a backend guarantee that the `_on_conflict`-related IR nodes never appear, by letting a backend `B` define `type XOnConflict B = Void`, making such nodes statically un-instantiateable.

While that's of course neat in some ways (i.e. it ensures the schema generators don't create IR nodes that the execution layer won't handle), it's also in itself a bit heavy, and worst of all it's one more thing that shared schema generating code needs to case switch over.

A better approach for dealing with `XOnConflict` and `ExtraInsertData` would be to have `ExtraInsertData` also handle the backend-specific concern of upserts (and other backend-specific insert stuff in the future), by removing `_aiConflictClause` from `data AnnIns` and have backends that support on-conflict clauses put something similar into their `ExtraInsertData`.
This would give us the same coherency guarantees between schema and execution as mentioned above, and centralize backend specific behavior in the backend specific type class instances, where they belong. This will require some refactoring of the schema code and the existing Postgres upsert implementation though.


```
+----------+     +----+     +--------------+     +-----+     +-----------------+
| Metadata | --> | IR | --> | Mutation AST | --> | SQL | --> | Execution on DB |
+----------+     +----+     +--------------+     +-----+     +-----------------+
```

### 2. Generate `upsert` mutation schema
```
+----------+     +----+
| Metadata | --> | IR |
+----------+     +----+
```

Generate schema for insert mutations with an `if_matched` clause, with permissions enforced. This broadly involves:

1. implementing the `upsert` object parser: implement `defaultConflictObject` for an MSSQL backend. Consider renaming the class method to use a more generic term like "upsert", e.g. `upsertObject`.

1. introducing a generic field parser for `upsert` arguments: introduce a new method on the `BackendSchema` typeclass to parse the upsert argument of an insert field for a given backend. For example:
    ```haskell
      mkUpsertParser ::
          MonadParse m =>
          Maybe (Parser 'Input m a) ->
          InputFieldsParser m (Maybe a)
    ```

1. implementing the field parser for MSSQL: implement `mkUpsertParser` to correctly parse the `if_matched` argument. The parser should return `InputFieldsParser [...] Nothing` when permissions are not met. The existing `mkConflictArg` can be used as a reference implementation.

1. update the `AnnInsert` IR: update `insertIntoTable` and `insertOneIntoTable` (at least) to use the newly introduced `BackendSchema` methods instead of `mkConflictArg`.

1. optionally, update `objectRelationshipInput` and `arrayRelationshipInput` to also use the `BackendSchema` field parser; however, this *may* not be neccesary as nested inserts are not yet supported on SQL Server.

*To verify:* The generated schema can be verified locally in Hasura Console's Documentation Explorer. This change, if successful, should result in the following generated schema diff for an example `author` table:
```diff
type mutation_root {
  insert_author(
    objects: [author_insert_input!]!
+   if_matched: author_if_matched
  ): author_mutation_response

  insert_author_one(
    object: author_insert_input!
+   if_matched: author_if_matched
  ): author
}

+input author_if_matched {
+  match_columns: author_match_columns!
+  update_columns: [author_update_column!]! = []
+  where: author_bool_exp
+}
```

The mutation, if attempted, won't succeed until the next step is implemented.

### 3. SQL generation & execution
```
+--------------+     +-----+     +-----------------+
| Mutation AST | --> | SQL | --> | Execution on DB |
+--------------+     +-----+     +-----------------+
```

This broadly involves:
1. creating an intermediate mutation AST: for example, `data Merge` in `Hasura.Backends.MSSQL.Types`.
     - [These notes on MSSQL upsert](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine-mono/issues/2427) give an example `MERGE` statement in context of HGE upserts.
     - Postgres' `SQLConflict` datatype can be used as a reference implementation.
1. using AST: including this new type as a field in MSSQL's `Insert` record
1. translating AST to a [SQL Server `MERGE` statement](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/statements/merge-transact-sql): update the `fromInsert` query printer to generate the correct `MERGE` statement when the upsert condition is met.

*To verify:* simple insert tests such as `test_on_conflict_update`, at a minimum, should now pass.
