-- | A 'Dependency' represents a value that a 'Rule' can /conditionally/ depend on. A 'Dependency'
-- is created using 'newDependency', and it can be “opened” again using 'dependOn'. What makes a
-- 'Dependency' useful is the way it cooperates with 'cache'---if a 'Dependency' is passed to a
-- cached rule, but that rule (or any of its sub-rules) never “opens” it using 'dependOn', then
-- subsequent executions of the rule will ignore the 'Dependency' when computing whether or not it
-- is necessary to re-execute the rule.
--
-- The above functionality is useful on its own to express conditional dependencies, but even more
-- useful is the ability to express /partial/ dependencies. For example, if a 'Dependency' contains
-- a 'HashMap', a rule can choose to only depend on the value associated with a particular key by
-- using 'selectKeyD' (or the more general 'selectD'). Only the parts that are actually used will be
-- counted when computing whether a rule needs to be re-executed.
