# Auto cleanup of event trigger logs

<div className='badge badge--primary heading-badge'>Available on: Cloud, Enterprise Edition</div>

:::note Supported from

Auto cleanup for event triggers is available from Hasura version `v2.13` and above.

:::

## Introduction

Hasura provides a way to automate the cleanup of the event trigger logs based on the following parameters:

| Name of the parameter | Description                                                                                               | Default | Example                                                                                                                       |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| clear_older_than      | Minimum age (in hours) of the event logs that need to be cleared from when the cleanup action is invoked. | -       | `clear_older_than: 168` means logs older than 168 hours (7 days) will be deleted.                                             |
| schedule              | Cron expression at which the cleanup should be invoked.                                                   | -       | A `0 0 * * *` schedule means that the cleanup will be invoked every day at 00:00 (UTC time).                                  |
| clean_invocation_logs | Option to indicate whether the corresponding invocation logs are also to be cleaned.                      | false   | `clean_invocation_logs: false` means that invocation logs will not be cleaned.                                                |
| batch_size            | Maximum number of logs to delete in a single statement during the cleanup action. If there are more events to be cleaned than the `batch_size` then the cleanup action will execute multiple statements sequentially until all old event logs are cleared. | 10000   | Suppose there are 10000 events pending deletion and a `batch_size` of 1000 then the cleanup will be performed in 10 batches sequentially. |
| timeout               | Maximum time (in seconds) that a batch can take during the cleanup process. If a batch times out, the cleanup process is halted. | 60      | A timeout of 60 means a batch of cleanup should not take more than 60 seconds. If a batch takes more than the `timeout`, then all the subsequent batches for the cleanup action will be cancelled. |
| paused                | Indicates if the auto-cleanup process is paused.                                                          | false   | `paused: true` means cleanup is paused, hence no logs will be deleted.                                                        |


## Auto cleanup

For automatic cleanup, you can provide a cleanup config while [adding the event
trigger](/event-triggers/create-trigger.mdx) and Hasura will clean up the logs according to the provided config.

<Tabs className="api-tabs">
<TabItem value="console" label="Console">

For an existing event trigger, head to the `Modify` tab of the event trigger and scroll down to the `Auto-cleanup Event
Logs` section.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

To add an auto cleanup config, update the `databases > [source-name] > tables > [table-name].yaml` file inside the
metadata directory as in this example:

```yaml {15-21}
table:
  name: users
  schema: public
event_triggers:
  - name: send_email
    definition:
      enable_manual: true
      insert:
        columns: '*'
    retry_conf:
      interval_sec: 10
      num_retries: 0
      timeout_sec: 60
    webhook: https://send.email
    cleanup_config:
      batch_size: 10000
      clean_invocation_logs: true
      clear_older_than: 168
      paused: false
      schedule: '0 0 * * *'
      timeout: 60
```

Apply the metadata by running:

```bash
hasura metadata apply
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="api" label="API">

You can add a auto cleanup config using the `<backend>_create_event_trigger` metadata API.

```http {15-22}
POST /v1/metadata HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
X-Hasura-Role: admin

{
  "type" : "pg_create_event_trigger",
  "args": {
    "name": "send_email",
    "source": "default",
    "table": "users",
    "insert": {
      "columns": "*"
    },
    "webhook": "https://send.email",
    "cleanup_config": {
      "batch_size": 10000,
      "clean_invocation_logs": true,
      "clear_older_than": 168,
      "paused": false,
      "schedule": "0 0 * * *",
      "timeout": 60
    }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


:::caution Warning

If you initially choose not to delete `invocation_logs`, but later they need to be deleted, you will need to delete
  the retained logs manually.

:::

## Manual APIs

For cleaning up the event trigger logs using an API, Hasura provides the
[cleanup_event_trigger_logs](/api-reference/metadata-api/event-triggers.mdx#metadata-cleanup-event-trigger-logs) API.


## Managing automatic cleaners

For the ease of managing automated cleanups, Hasura provides few metadata APIs such as:

- [resume_event_trigger_cleanups](/api-reference/metadata-api/event-triggers.mdx#metadata-start-event-trigger-cleanups):
  This API resumes the cleanup process (sets `paused` to `false`).
- [pause_event_trigger_cleanups](/api-reference/metadata-api/event-triggers.mdx#metadata-pause-event-trigger-cleanups):
  This API pauses the cleanup process (sets `paused` to `true`).

:::tip Tip

While applying migrations, you may pause all the installed cleaners for better performance.

:::

### API usage examples

- Activate the cleaners on all the triggers defined on all the event-trigger-supported sources
```json
POST /v1/metadata HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
X-Hasura-Role: admin

{
  "type" : "resume_event_trigger_cleanups",
  "args": {
    "event_triggers": {
      "sources": "*"
    }
  }
}
```

- Activate the cleaners on all the triggers defined on the sources: `source_1`,
  `source_2`
```json
POST /v1/metadata HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
X-Hasura-Role: admin

{
  "type" : "resume_event_trigger_cleanups",
  "args": {
    "event_triggers": {
      "sources": ["source_1", "source_2"]
    }
  }
}
```

- Activate the cleaners on triggers: `sample_trigger_1`, `sample_trigger_2`
  defined on source `default`
```json
POST /v1/metadata HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
X-Hasura-Role: admin

{
  "type": "resume_event_trigger_cleanups",
  "args": {
    "event_triggers": [
      {
        "source_name": "default",
        "event_triggers": ["sample_trigger_1", "sample_trigger_2"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

:::info Note

The management APIs will only affect the event trigger log cleaners if the event triggers have cleaners configured.
