# Get Started with Snowflake

To try Hasura with Snowflake, you'll need a new or existing Snowflake database.

Here are 2 ways you can get started with Hasura and Snowflake:

1.  [Hasura Cloud](/databases/snowflake/getting-started/cloud.mdx) : You'll need to be able to access your Snowflake
    service from Hasura Cloud.
2.  [Docker](/databases/snowflake/getting-started/docker.mdx): Run Hasura with Docker and then connect your Snowflake
    service to Hasura.

:::info Using Kubernetes?

We have Helm charts available for deploying Hasura on Kubernetes. Check out
[more information here](/deployment/deployment-guides/kubernetes-helm.mdx) and see the
[`enterprise-stack` here](https://github.com/hasura/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/hasura-enterprise-stack).
