title: "Mutation to create todo"

Users can create new todos in public list as well. This seems like functionality that we have already written during private todos.

Reusing React Component
-----------------------
Take a look at the file `src/components/Todo/TodoInput.js` and this is the same component that is being reused for Public List UI as well.
