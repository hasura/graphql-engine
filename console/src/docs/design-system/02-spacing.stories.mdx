# Spacing

Most style guides start with colors and typography. We're going to start with spacing since it's one of the most important design elements when it comes to creating a consistent interface.

## 8px Grid

By relying on an 8px grid we can create a rhythm both vertically and horizontally. To ensure consistent spacing across the application.

One of the main tenants of the 8px grid is to have everything scale in proportional rhythm (for example a common pattern is `8px` for `sm`, `16` for `md`, `24` for `lg`).

Less useful for our use-case is that 8px also multiplies evenly across different display resolutions (so for flat designs a 8px vector will display with 16px density on 2x retina displays, and 32px on 3x retina displays).

Some more resources on it can be found here: [https://tanzu.vmware.com/content/built-to-adapt/intro-to-the-8-point-grid-system-2](https://tanzu.vmware.com/content/built-to-adapt/intro-to-the-8-point-grid-system-2)

## Spacing

Spacing between elements is best thought of using a sort of spacer model. Generally safe spacing between objects is between the 8px and 24px range.

`4px` (`xs`) is used as an outlier to separate things which should be close together (usually horizontally - ie. horizontal form fields or inline buttons).

`8px` (`sm`) is used for separating objects in the same family (ie. form field rows).

`16px` (`md`) is used for separating like-items in the same system (ie. multiple cards, or a section in the same form).

`24px` (`lg`) is used to differentiate different systems.

<div className="grid grid-cols-4">
  <div>
    <div>xs</div>
    <div className="h-xs w-xs border border-2 border-dashed border-[#EF4444] bg-[#FECACA]" />
  </div>
  <div>
    <div>sm</div>
    <div className="h-sm w-sm border border-2 border-dashed border-[#10B981] bg-[#A7F3D0]" />
  </div>
  <div>
    <div>md</div>
    <div className="h-md w-md border border-2 border-dashed border-[#10B981] bg-[#A7F3D0]" />
  </div>
  <div>
    <div>lg</div>
    <div className="h-lg w-lg border border-2 border-dashed border-[#EF4444] bg-[#FECACA]" />
  </div>
</div>


## What to avoid?
Avoiding double-spacing is a key to having a consistent vertical rhythm.

For example, if we have a button with a small (8px) spacing, inside a form with a large spacing (16px), we'd actually end up with an extra-large (32px) space below the form.
