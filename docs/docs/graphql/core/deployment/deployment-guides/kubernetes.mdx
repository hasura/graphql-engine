# Run Hasura GraphQL engine on Kubernetes

## Introduction

This guide assumes that you already have Postgres running and helps you
set up the Hasura GraphQL engine on Kubernetes and connect it to your
Postgres database.

## Deploying Hasura using Kubernetes

### Step 1: Get the Kubernetes deployment and service files

The [hasura/graphql-engine/install-manifests](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/tree/stable/install-manifests)
repo contains all installation manifests required to deploy Hasura
anywhere. Get the Kubernetes deployment and service files from there:

```bash
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hasura/graphql-engine/stable/install-manifests/kubernetes/deployment.yaml
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hasura/graphql-engine/stable/install-manifests/kubernetes/svc.yaml
```

### Step 2: Set the Postgres database url

Edit `deployment.yaml` and set the right database url:

```yaml {4}
...
  env:
  - name: HASURA_GRAPHQL_DATABASE_URL
    value: postgres://<username>:<password>@hostname:<port>/<dbname>
...
```

Examples of `HASURA_GRAPHQL_DATABASE_URL`:

-   `postgres://admin:password@localhost:5432/my-db`
-   `postgres://admin:@localhost:5432/my-db` *(if there is no password)*

:::info Note

-   If your **password contains special characters** (e.g. #, %, $, @,
    etc.), you need to URL encode them in the
    `HASURA_GRAPHQL_DATABASE_URL` env var (e.g. %40 for @).

    You can check the [logs](#kubernetes-logs) to see if the database
    credentials are proper and if Hasura is able to connect to the
    database.

-   The Hasura GraphQL engine needs access permissions on your Postgres
    database as described in
    [Postgres permissions](/graphql/core/deployment/postgres-requirements.mdx#postgres-permissions).

:::

### Step 3: Create the Kubernetes deployment and service

```bash
$ kubectl create -f deployment.yaml
$ kubectl create -f svc.yaml
```

### Step 4: Open the Hasura console

The above creates a LoadBalancer type service with port 80. So you
should be able to access the console at the external IP.

For example, using Docker-for-desktop on Mac:

```bash
$ kubectl get svc
NAME         TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
hasura       LoadBalancer   10.96.214.240   localhost     80:30303/TCP   4m
kubernetes   ClusterIP      10.96.0.1       <none>        443/TCP        8m
```

Head to: `http://localhost` and the console should load!

### Step 5: Track existing tables and relationships

See [Setting up a GraphQL schema using an existing Postgres database](/graphql/core/databases/postgres/schema/using-existing-database.mdx) to enable GraphQL over the database.

## Securing the GraphQL endpoint {#kubernetes-secure}

To make sure that your GraphQL endpoint and the Hasura console are not
publicly accessible, you need to configure an admin secret key.

### Add the HASURA_GRAPHQL_ADMIN_SECRET env var

Update the `deployment.yaml` to set the `HASURA_GRAPHQL_ADMIN_SECRET`
environment variable.

```yaml {10-11}
...
spec:
   containers:
     ...
     command: ["graphql-engine"]
     args: ["serve", "--enable-console"]
     env:
     - name: HASURA_GRAPHQL_DATABASE_URL
       value: postgres://<username>:<password>@hostname:<port>/<dbname>
     - name: HASURA_GRAPHQL_ADMIN_SECRET
       value: mysecretkey
     ports:
     - containerPort: 8080
       protocol: TCP
     resources: {}
```

:::info  Note

The `HASURA_GRAPHQL_ADMIN_SECRET` should never be passed from the client
to the Hasura GraphQL engine as it would give the client full admin
rights to your Hasura instance. See [Authentication & Authorization](/graphql/core/auth/index.mdx) for information on setting up
authentication.

:::

### (optional) Use the admin secret key with the CLI

In case you're using the CLI to open the Hasura console, use the
`admin-secret` flag when you open the console:

```bash
hasura console --admin-secret=<myadminsecretkey>
```

## Hasura GraphQL engine server logs {#kubernetes-logs}

You can check the logs of the Hasura GraphQL engine deployed on
Kubernetes by checking the logs of the GraphQL engine service, i.e.
`hasura`:

```bash
$ kubectl logs -f svc/hasura

{"timestamp":"2018-10-09T11:20:32.054+0000", "level":"info", "type":"http-log", "detail":{"status":200, "query_hash":"01640c6dd131826cff44308111ed40d7fbd1cbed", "http_version":"HTTP/1.1", "query_execution_time":3.0177627e-2, "request_id":null, "url":"/v1/graphql", "user":{"x-hasura-role":"admin"}, "ip":"127.0.0.1", "response_size":209329, "method":"POST", "detail":null}}
...
```

    for more details on logging in Kubernetes.

## Updating Hasura GraphQL engine {#kubernetes-update}

This guide will help you update the Hasura GraphQL engine running on
Kubernetes. This guide assumes that you already have the Hasura GraphQL
engine running on Kubernetes.

### Step 1: Check the latest release version

The current latest version is:

<code>hasura/graphql-engine:<LatestRelease /></code>

All the versions can be found at: [https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/releases](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/releases).

### Step 2: Update the container image

In the `deployment.yaml` file, update the image tag to this latest
version.

For example, if you had:

```yaml
containers:
  - image: hasura/graphql-engine:v1.0.0-alpha01
```

you should change it to:


<pre>
<code>
containers:<br />
{"  "}- image: hasura/graphql-engine:<LatestRelease />
</code>
</pre>

### Step 3: Rollout the change

```bash
$ kubectl replace -f deployment.yaml
```

:::info Note

If you are downgrading to an older version of the GraphQL engine you
might need to downgrade your metadata catalogue version as described in
[Downgrading Hasura GraphQL engine](/graphql/core/deployment/downgrading.mdx)
