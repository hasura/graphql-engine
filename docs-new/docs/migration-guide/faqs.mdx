<summary>How to start the migration process?</summary>

Used an auto transform tool [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org) to transform `reStructiredText` to `GitHub flavoured markdown` and added the resultant markdown content in respective `.txt` files.

You will be working in the `docs-new/docs/graphql` directory. Here you can find the `.txt` files already added from auto-transform result. So, you don't have to create any new files.

Below is the steps to complete the migration cylcle for each doc file.

Update the extension and migrate content.

1. Convert the transformed `.rst.txt` to `.mdx` extension for the file to be able to show up in sidebar and UI.

2. Use this migration guide for syntactical and usage reference.

3. Validate content and cleanup misc divs that are populated during auto transform and any invalid mdx data.

4. The misc populated divs exist to ease adding metadata and any sphinx directives that can't be auto transformed to markdown. Please cross referene the actual RST file for content validation.

Verify content correctness (compare against the current live version of [Hasura docs](https://hasura.io/docs/)) and preview in UI.

<summary>How to control sidebar label & items order?</summary>

**For Individual Files**
Make use of `sidebar_label` and `sidebar_position` meta

```markdown
---
sidebar_label: Hasura Core
sidebar_position: 3
---
```

**For Directories (Categories)**
Please add a `__category__.json` and add the `label` and `position` properties.

```json
{
  "label": "Hasura Core",
  "position": 1
}
```

Please read the docusaurus docs about this here - https://docusaurus.io/docs/sidebar#autogenerated-sidebar-metadata

<summary>index file routes are resolved to `directory/` and not `directory/index`</summary>

Use `slug` metadata to manually set the slug to `directory/index`. Please check [this PR on docusaurus](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/5830) for more information.

```markdown title="index.mdx"
---
...
slug: /migration-guide/index
---
```

<details>
<summary>A directory is not visible in sidebar when only index.mdx file exists</summary>

This is known and default behaviour from docusaurus. `index` is considered direct link to directory index and won't be visible unless there is one more file.

To fix, rename the file from `index.mdx` to `directory-name.mdx` and remove the directory.

:::caution Wait, There are other files. But, not migrated yet!
In this case, migrate the non-index file first so that directory shows up and continue migrating index file.

<summary>How to link (internal) other documents that are not migrated yet?</summary>

Currently, broken MDX links are set to warn to ease the migration process. So, add the file path as link.

To get the file path, do a global search for id in `graphql-engine/docs/graphql/` directory and use the respective file path.

![Link File Path From Ref Screencapture](/img/migration-guide/link-file-path-from-ref.png)

:::tip
You can prepend the id with `.. _` to only get the file id as result and not include the usage files.
:::

Hey, this can be even simplified if you reference the current [live docs](https://hasura.io/docs/). Click the link in docs and copy the URL strarting from `graphql`.
Please make sure to handle extension (remove `.html`) and also add the `#hash-part` if linking to a sub section.

The root relative link should start at `graphql` directory level.

Ex: Link from above screnshot `/graphql/core/api-reference/metadata-api/actions.mdx`

```markdown
[actions Metadata API](/graphql/core/api-reference/metadata-api/actions.mdx)

<!-- If using Link component -->
<Link to="/graphql/core/api-reference/metadata-api/actions">actions Metadata API</Link>
```
Please refer [Links](/migration-guide/links.mdx) for more information about links usage.
