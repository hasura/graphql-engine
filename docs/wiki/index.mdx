# Hasura Docs Wiki

Welcome to the Hasura Docs Wiki! We're glad you're here and are excited to see your docs contributions. They're going to
be great ðŸ™Œ

On the following pages, you'll find all the information you need to get started. A perfect place to begin would be the
[Contributing to Docs](/contributions.mdx) page that will walk you through the end-to-end contribution process from
setting up your local development environment to creating your first PR.

:::tip New to open-source?

If you're here looking to get into open-source, a docs contribution is a great first step. We'd love to work with you on
one of the issues labeled
[`good first issue` on GitHub](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).
Check out the list and follow our contribution guide below. If you have questions about the process,
[reach out to us on Discord](https://discord.gg/ss4knTGzeP)!

:::

After your local environment is set up, feel free to poke around the style guide, explanation of our page structures,
and info on working with Docusaurus (our docs framework).
