# Allow-list of operations

## Introduction

The **Allow-list** is a list of safe operations (*GraphQL queries,
mutations or subscriptions*) that is stored by the GraphQL engine in its
metadata. When enabled, it can be used to restrict the GraphQL engine so
that it executes **only** those operations that are present in the list
*(available after version v1.0.0-beta.1)*.

## Adding or removing a operation in allow-list

You can add or remove a operation in the allow-list in two ways:

-   **Using the console:** Head to the `Settings` (âš™) --> `Allow list`
    section in the console. You can add a new operation to the
    allow-list or upload a list of new operations from a file that will
    be added to the allow-list. You can also see a list of existing
    operations in the allow-list and delete them individually.
    -   You can add an individual operation, like the one below,
        manually to the allow-list with a unique name. Note that this
        unique name is just an identifier for the query in the
        collection, it is not related to the operation name of the
        query.

        ```graphql
        query ($id: Int!){
           user_by_pk(id: $id){
             __typename
             id
             name
             company
           }
        }
        ```

    -   You can upload files, like this [sample file](https://gist.github.com/dsandip/8b1b4aa87708289d4c9f8fd9621eb025),
        to add multiple operations to the allow-list (each operation
        needs to have a name).
-   **Using metadata APIs:** Queries can be stored in collections and a
    collection can be added to or removed from the allow-list. See
    [Collections & Allow-list APIs](/graphql/core/api-reference/metadata-api/query-collections.mdx) for
    API reference.

:::info Note

-  The allow list queries are validated against the schema. So, adding an invalid query will result in inconsistent metadata error.

-   `__typename` introspection fields will be ignored when adding
    operations and comparing them to the allow-list.

-   Any introspection queries that your client apps require will have to
    be explicitly added to the allow-list to allow running them.

-   The order of fields in a query will be **strictly** compared. E.g.
    assuming the query in the first example above is part of the
    allow-list, the following query will be **rejected**:

    ```graphql
    query ($id: Int!){
       user_by_pk(id: $id){
         __typename
         name
         id
         company
       }
    }
    ```

-   The allow-list is stored in the metadata. To version control the
    state of the list, you are required to export the metadata. See
    [Managing Hasura metadata](/graphql/core/migrations/manage-metadata.mdx) for more details.

-   You can modify the allow-list without actually enabling it on your instance.

## Role based allow-list

A role based allow-list is useful when you would like a query collection to be accessible to only certain roles.

:::info Note

Role based allow-lists are supported in cloud/enterprise products,
from version ``v2.3.0``. In OSS, role based allow-lists entries are ignored.

On older versions (which do not support role based allow-lists), any role based allow-list metadata entry will get treated as global. Hence, caution is advised when using role based allow-list metadata with older versions.

:::

## Enable allow-list

The allow-list validation can be enabled by setting the
`HASURA_GRAPHQL_ENABLE_ALLOWLIST` environment variable to `true` or
running the GraphQL engine with the `--enable-allowlist` flag (*default
value is* `false`). See [reference docs](/graphql/core/deployment/graphql-engine-flags/reference.mdx#command-flags).

:::info Note

The allow-list validation will not be enforced for the `admin` role.

:::

## Recommended usage

The following are the recommended best practices for enabling/disabling
allow-list based validation:

-   **In development instances**: During development or in dev
    instances, disable allow-list (*default setting*) to allow complete
    access to the GraphQL schema. Add/remove operations in the
    allow-list and then export the metadata for version-control (*so you
    can apply it to other instances*).
-   **In CI/CD instances**: Enable the allow-list for testing.
-   **In production instances**: Enabling the allow-list is highly
    recommended when running the GraphQL engine in production.

:::info Allow Lists in Hasura Cloud

Hasura Cloud lets you generate allowed queries from real usage in your
application. For more, information, see
