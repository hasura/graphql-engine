# Allow List of operations

## Introduction

The **Allow-list** is a list of safe operations (_GraphQL queries, mutations or subscriptions_) that is stored by the
GraphQL engine in its metadata. When enabled, it can be used to restrict the GraphQL engine so that it executes **only**
those operations that are present in the list _(available after version v1.0.0-beta.1)_.

## Adding or removing an operation in allow-list

You can add or remove an operation in the allow-list in two ways:

- **Using the console:** Head to the `Settings` (âš™) --> `Allow list` section in the console. You can add a new operation
  to the allow-list or upload a list of new operations from a file that will be added to the allow-list. You can also
  see a list of existing operations in the allow-list and delete them individually.

- You can add an individual operation, like the one below, manually to the allow-list with a unique name. Note that this
  unique name is just an identifier for the query in the collection, it is not related to the operation name of the
  query.

```graphql
query ($id: Int!) {
  user_by_pk(id: $id) {
    __typename
    id
    name
    company
  }
}
```

- You can upload files, like this [sample file](https://gist.github.com/dsandip/8b1b4aa87708289d4c9f8fd9621eb025), to
  add multiple operations to the allow-list (each operation needs to have a name).

- **Using metadata APIs:** Queries can be stored in collections and a collection can be added to or removed from the
  allow-list. See [Collections & Allow-list APIs](/api-reference/metadata-api/query-collections.mdx) for API reference.

:::info Note

- The allow list queries are validated against the schema. So, adding an invalid query will result in inconsistent
  metadata error.

- `__typename` introspection fields will be ignored when adding operations and comparing them to the allow-list.

- Any introspection queries that your client apps require will have to be explicitly added to the allow-list to allow
  running them.

- The order of fields in a query will be **strictly** compared. E.g. assuming the query in the first example above is
  part of the allow-list, the following query will be **rejected**:

```graphql
query ($id: Int!) {
  user_by_pk(id: $id) {
    __typename
    name
    id
    company
  }
}
```

- The allow-list is stored in the metadata. To version control the state of the list, you are required to export the
  metadata. See [Managing Hasura metadata](/migrations-metadata-seeds/manage-metadata.mdx) for more details.

- You can modify the allow-list without actually enabling it on your instance.

## Role based Allow List

A role based allow-list is useful when you would like a query collection to be accessible to only certain roles.

:::info Note

Role based allow-lists are supported in cloud/enterprise products, from version `v2.3.0`. In OSS, role based allow-lists
entries are ignored.

On older versions (which do not support role based allow-lists), any role based allow-list metadata entry will get
treated as global. Hence, caution is advised when using role based allow-list metadata with older versions.

:::

## Enable Allow List

The allow-list validation can be enabled by setting the `HASURA_GRAPHQL_ENABLE_ALLOWLIST` environment variable to `true`
or running the GraphQL engine with the `--enable-allowlist` flag (_default value is_ `false`). See
[reference docs](/deployment/graphql-engine-flags/reference.mdx#command-flags).

:::info Note

The allow-list validation will not be enforced for the `admin` role.

## Quick-create allowed operations

This feature lets you add to the allow list with one click from the record of past operations. (With Core, allow lists
must be managed manually.

## Recommended usage

The following are the recommended best practices for enabling/disabling allow-list based validation:

- **In development instances**: During development or in dev instances, disable allow-list (_default setting_) to allow
  complete access to the GraphQL schema. Add/remove operations in the allow-list and then export the metadata for
  version-control (_so you can apply it to other instances_).
- **In CI/CD instances**: Enable the allow-list for testing.
- **In production instances**: Enabling the allow-list is highly recommended when running the GraphQL engine in
  production.
