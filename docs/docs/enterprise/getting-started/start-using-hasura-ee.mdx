# Start Using Hasura EE

<ProductBadge self />

## Instructions

After following one of the Hasura Enterprise Edition get started guides:

- Head to `http://localhost:8080/console` to open the Hasura Console.
- Log in using the admin secret key that you set.
- Learn more about [connecting data sources](/databases/quickstart.mdx).
- Check out the [Hasura Enterprise features](/enterprise/overview.mdx).

## Complete your production-readiness checklist (optional)

When you are ready to move Hasura to production, check out our
[production-readiness checklist](/deployment/production-checklist.mdx). In addition, please ensure the following:

- Make sure you are using a fully managed Redis and Postgres instance (for metadata). Set alerts on them to ensure
  continuous availability.
- We recommend running Hasura with at least 4 CPU cores and a minimum of 8 GB RAM in production. Please set autoscaling
  on CPU.
- [Enable and consume metrics](/observability/enterprise-edition/prometheus/index.mdx).
