# Sample Auth Webhook for Hasura GraphQL engine

This is a sample auth webhook for authenticating requests to the Hasura GraphQL engine.

It has boilerplate code written for auth0 and firebase auth. There is also a generic sample handler in `server.js` where you can handle your custom auth providers.

## Usage with Hasura GraphQL engine

Once you have deployed this webhook, you can use it along with the GraphQL engine. You have to set the webhook URL as an environment variable in the docker container that runs the GraphQL engine.

}
```

### Firebase

Send the firebase `id_token` as a header while making queries to the `graphql-engine`.

```
{
  "Authorization": "Bearer <id_token>"
