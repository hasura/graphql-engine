# Exporting the Hasura GraphQL schema

## Introduction

If you need to share, introspect or export the GraphQL schema, you can
use community tooling such as
[graphqurl](https://github.com/hasura/graphqurl), [Apollo
CLI](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-tooling),
[get-graphql-schema](https://github.com/prismagraphql/get-graphql-schema),
etc.

## Using **graphqurl**

For example, using `graphqurl`, you can get the schema as follows:

Run `npm install -g graphqurl` to install `graphqurl`. Then you can run
the following commands to download the GraphQL schema:

```bash
# If the GraphQL engine is running at https://my-graphql-engine.com/v1/graphql,
# without an admin secret
gq https://my-graphql-engine.com/v1/graphql --introspect > schema.graphql

# If Hasura GraphQL engine is running with an admin secret
gq https://my-graphql-engine.com/v1/graphql -H "X-Hasura-Admin-Secret: adminsecretkey" --introspect > schema.graphql
```

By default, it downloads the schema in `.graphql` format. If you want it
in JSON format, you can use an additional flag `--format json`:

```bash
# Getting the schema in .json format
gq https://my-graphql-engine.com/v1/graphql --introspect --format json > schema.json
```

## Using **Apollo CLI**

Using Apollo CLI, you can get the schema as follows:

Run `npm install -g apollo` to install the Apollo CLI. You can then run
the following command to download the GraphQL schema:

```bash
# If the GraphQL engine is running at https://my-graphql-engine.com/v1/graphql,
# without an admin secret
apollo schema:download --endpoint https://my-graphql-engine.com/v1/graphql

# If Hasura GraphQL engine is running with an admin secret
apollo schema:download --endpoint https://my-graphql-engine.com/v1/graphql --header "X-Hasura-Admin-Secret: adminsecretkey"
```

Note that `apollo schema:download` is an alias of the command [apollo service:download](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-tooling#apollo-servicedownload-output).

By default, this downloads the schema to a file called `schema.json`.
This command has no other output types.
