# Hasura - Citus compatibility

## Introduction

As Citus is an extension of Postgres, the way it functions with Hasura
is also very similar. Currently the following features are supported
with Citus and Hasura:

## Tables

Querying from all kinds of tables and views is currently supported. This
includes local, reference and distributed tables. All the tables can be
tracked from the console.

## Relationships

The following table describes the supported relationships based on the
supported joins in Citus:

|                      | To Local      | To Reference  | To Distributed |
|----------------------|---------------|---------------|----------------|
| **From Local**       | Object, Array | Object, Array |                |
| **From Reference**   | Object, Array | Object, Array |                |
| **From Distributed** |               | Object        | Object, Array  |

The Hasura console allows you to add all the supported relationships.

## Permissions

All permissions work like on Postgres without any restrictions.

## Functions

Citus supported `plpgsql` functions are supported on Hasura with the
following restrictions:

-   Fetching relationships as part of the functionâ€™s response is
    currently not supported

## Mutations

Mutations are supported in GraphQL engine with the following
restrictions:

-   Fetching relationship data as part of `returning` is not yet
    supported

## Event triggers

Citus does not yet support creating triggers ([See issue](https://github.com/citusdata/citus/issues/4425)) on reference
tables. Hence this is currently not supported.
