# RESTified Endpoint Config

In this document, we cover the RESTified endpoint configuration options. We will also cover how to use the RESTified
endpoint to query and mutate data in your database.

:::info Subscriptions and RESTified endpoints

Currently, only queries and mutations are supported in RESTified endpoints.

## Configuration options {#configuration-options}

Four fields are required to configure a RESTified endpoint:

| Field             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Name              | The name of the endpoint. This will be used to identify the endpoint in the RESTified endpoint list.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Location          | The path of the endpoint. This will be appended to the base URL of your Hasura instance to form the full URL of the endpoint.<br /><br /> The location can contain variables, which will be replaced with the values of the corresponding arguments when the endpoint is called. For example, if the location is `/api/rest/carts/:userId`, then `userId` will be replaced with the value of the `userId` argument when the endpoint is called. |
| HTTP method       | The HTTP method to use when making requests to the endpoint. This can be either `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, or `DELETE`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| GraphQL operation | The GraphQL query to execute when the endpoint is called. This can be either a query or a mutation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

## Examples

### Queries {#queries}

#### Simple endpoints

Simple endpoints are endpoints that do not have any arguments. A common use case for simple endpoints is to expose a
list of all the items in a table. In the example below, we will create a RESTified endpoint for the `products` table,
allowing us to fetch all the products in the database.

We would begin by writing a GraphQL query in the GraphiQL IDE:

```graphql
query AllProductsQuery {
  products {
    id
    name
    manufacturerByManufacturer {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```

After entering the query, we'd then click the `REST` button in the Explorer to configure the endpoint. On the
configuration screen that appears, enter whatever name you wish. In the `Location` field, as our query does not have any
arguments, we can simply set this to `/products`.

This means that the endpoint will be available at `https://<your-domain>/api/rest/products` and hitting it will return
the result of the query, being the list of all the products in the database.

As this endpoint is fetching data, we'd select `GET` as the HTTP method.

After clicking `Create`, you would be able to access the endpoint at `https://<your-domain>/api/rest/products` and see
the list of products.

#### Endpoints with arguments

Suppose we only want to fetch the products that are produced by a specific manufacturer. We can do this by adding a
`where` clause to our query and passing in the manufacturer's ID as an argument to the endpoint:

```graphql
query AllProductsQuery($manufacturerId: uuid!) {
  products(where: { manufacturer: { _eq: $manufacturerId } }) {
    id
    name
    manufacturerByManufacturer {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```

The only difference between this query and the previous one is the addition of the `where` clause. This clause allows us
to filter the results of the query based on the value of the `manufacturer` column. We can utilize this value in our
endpoint by passing it in as an argument. Instead of our endpoint being `/products`, we'd set it to
`/products/:manufacturerId`.

Hasura will parse the `manufacturerId` argument from the URL and pass it to the query as a variable. This means that the
endpoint will be available at `https://<your-domain>/api/rest/products/:manufacturerId` and hitting it will return the
result of the query, being the list of products belonging to the manufacturer with the specified ID.

### Mutations {#mutations}

Mutations work identically to queries, except that they are executed using a `POST` request. The response will be the
result of the mutation as you've configured it.

To add an item to a cart, we'll need to insert a new row using the `insert_carts_items_one` mutation:

```graphql
mutation CreateCartItemMutation($product_id: uuid!, $quantity: Int!, $cart_id: uuid!) {
  insert_cart_items_one(object: { product_id: $product_id, quantity: $quantity, cart_id: $cart_id }) {
    id
    cart_id
  }
}
```

For simple mutations, we can use the same approach as we did for queries by accepting a query parameter for the
necessary field. However, we can also send JSON data in the request body. This is useful for mutations that require
multiple arguments. For the example above, we'd set the `Location` to `/cartItem`. We could then use the following curl
command to add an item to a cart:

```bash
curl -H "<YOUR_ADMIN_SECRET>" -X POST https://<YOUR_DOMAIN>/api/rest/cartItem/ -d '{
"product_id": "7992fdfa-65b5-11ed-8612-6a8b11ef7372",
"quantity": 1,
"cart_id": "e6e0edc0-673d-11ed-8a25-7224baf239e5"
}'
```

Note that the `product_id`, `quantity`, and `cart_id` fields are required and match the names of the arguments in the
mutation. As in our mutation, the returned values are the `id` and `cart_id` fields.

## Use cases

Ultimately, RESTified queries are not promoted as the primary interface to Hasura due to the lower flexibility and
expressivity compared to native GraphQL queries, as well as the normal GraphQL query interface being the best place to
develop the queries that could be RESTified later. The feature exists to augment the features of Hasura and make Hasura
easier to adopt in environments that have a heavier REST focus than GraphQL.

Below, you'll find several scenarios in which REST endpoints could be useful.

### Simplifying client code

Rather than having to adapt application stacks and tools, RESTified endpoints can be created to allow use of existing
processes. This is enhanced by providing OpenAPI documentation for the endpoints to allow automatic integration where
supported.

### Simplifying access control

Having a limited GraphQL query allow-list can add protection against accidental or intentional DOS, however this
requires that the allowed queries be known ahead of time. By using the RESTified queries API, these can be dynamically
curated for users so that they don't have to change client code to adapt to new policies.

### Simplifying onboarding

Rather than distributing recommended usage patterns of the GraphQL API out-of-band, a curated set of RESTified endpoints
can serve as a very easy way to get users up to speed with a Hasura instance by providing “recommended patterns.” Since
the associated GraphQL query is available for review, users can always adapt the RESTified endpoint into a customized
GraphQL query if required.

RESTified queries could also be used for “tightening up” usage patterns when moving from the experimentation/development
phase to the production/maintenance phase and used as a requirement for transitioning application maturity.

### Simplifying caching

Related to curation, [directives such as `@cached`](/caching/overview.mdx) can be applied to queries to ensure that
cached responses are always requested instead of leaving that up to the client and possibly omitting them when they
should be used.

HTTP caching headers are also inserted when `@cached` directives are applied which can be taken advantage of by many
HTTP clients so that manual/explicit caching logic doesn't need to be written in applications.
