# BigQuery: Database to Remote Schema Relationships

## Introduction

Database to Remote Schema relationships extend the concept of joining data across tables, to joining across tables and
remote GraphQL sources. Once you create relationships between types from your database and types created from remote
schemas, you can then "join" them by running GraphQL queries.

These APIs can be custom GraphQL servers you write, third party SaaS APIs, or even other Hasura instances.

Because Hasura is meant to be a GraphQL server that you can expose directly to your apps, Hasura also handles security
and authorization while providing remote joins.

:::info Note

[blog post](https://hasura.io/blog/remote-joins-a-graphql-api-to-join-database-and-other-data-sources/).

:::tip Supported from

Remote Schema relationships from BigQuery are supported from versions `v1.3.0` and above.

## Create Remote Schema relationships

### Step 1: Add a Remote Schema and a database

Add a Remote Schema and a database as described [here](/remote-schemas/adding-schema.mdx) and
[here](/databases/overview.mdx), if not already added.

### Step 2: Define and create the relationship

The following fields can be defined for a Remote Schema relationship:

- **Name**: Define a name for the relationship.
- **Remote Schema**: Select a Remote Schema among all the ones you've created.
- **Configuration**: Set up the join configuration, to inject values as input arguments of the Remote Schema field.
  - **From column**: Input injected from table column values.
  - **From static value**: Input injected from a static value of your choice.

For example, let's assume that our database has a table `articles(id int, author_id int)` and we've added a remote
schema `author-remote-schema`.

1.  We name the relationship `user`.
2.  We select the `author-remote-schema` that we've added.
3.  We set up the config to join the `id` input argument of our Remote Schema field to the `author_id` column of this
    table (in this case, the `articles` table).

- Head to the `Data -> [table-name] -> Relationships` tab.
- Click the `Add a remote relationship` button.

- Define the relationship and hit `Save`.

Update the `databases > [database-name] > tables > [table-name].yaml` file in the `metadata` directory:

```yaml {4-13}
- table:
    dataset: source
    name: author
  remote_relationships:
    - name: author
      definition:
        remote_field:
          author:
            arguments:
              id: $id
        hasura_fields:
          - author_id
        remote_schema: author-remote-schema
```

Apply the Metadata by running:

```bash
hasura metadata apply
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="api" label="API">

You can add a Remote Schema relationship by using the
[bigquery_create_remote_relationship](/api-reference/metadata-api/remote-relationships.mdx#metadata-bigquery-create-remote-relationship)
Metadata API:

```http
POST /v1/metadata HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
X-Hasura-Role: admin

{
  "type": "bigquery_create_remote_relationship",
  "args": {
    "name": "articles",
    "source": "bq-source",
    "table": {
      "dataset": "<source_dataset_name>",
      "name": "author"
    },
    "definition": {
      "to_remote_schema": {
        "remote_schema": "<remote_schema_name>",
        "lhs_fields": ["id"],
        "remote_field": {
          "articles": {
            "arguments": {
              "author_id": "$id"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Step 3: Explore with GraphiQL

In the `API` tab, test out your Remote Schema relationship.

<GraphiQLIDE
  query={`query {
  articles {
    id
    author_id
    user {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}`}
  response={`{
  "data": {
    "articles": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "author_id": 2,
        "user": {
          "id": 2,
          "name": "Bob"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}`}
/>

## Remote Schema relationship permissions

Remote Schema relationship permissions are derived from the
[Remote Schema permissions](/remote-schemas/auth/remote-schema-permissions.mdx) defined for the role. When a remote
relationship permission cannot be derived, the remote relationship field will not be added to the schema for the role.

Some cases in which a remote relationship permission cannot be derived are:

1.  There are no Remote Schema permissions defined for the role.
2.  The role doesn't have access to the field or types that are used by the remote relationship.

:::info Note

Remote relationship permissions apply only if Remote Schema permissions are enabled in GraphQL Engine.
