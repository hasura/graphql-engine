# Get Started with Docker and Snowflake

Testing is currently underway on the Snowflake connector for use in self-hosted environments. Our suggested
installation method is to use Docker Compose to deploy a working deployment of Hasura with the Snowflake Connector
enabled.

In order to do this, follow the instructions for
[Hasura Enterprise Edition](/enterprise/getting-started/quickstart-docker.mdx), but change out the Docker Compose files
listed in that documentation to these values:

```bash
# in a new directory run
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hasura/graphql-engine/master/install-manifests/enterprise/snowflake/docker-compose.yaml
# or run
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hasura/graphql-engine/master/install-manifests/enterprise/snowflake/docker-compose.yaml -o docker-compose.yml
```

When you use these to launch the services, you'll see three containers running instead of two. The third container is
the Snowflake GraphQL Connector agent. By navigating to the Hasura Console after execution, you'll find the Snowflake
data source as a type that can now be added to your Hasura GraphQL Service instance.

## Keep up to date

:::info Note

Currently, Hasura supports read-only queries, relationships, and permissions on Snowflake.

Please watch this space to get the latest docs on how you can try these features out via the Console or by manipulating
metadata in JSON/YAML directly.
