# <DataFederation /> Data Federation

## Introduction

Hasuraâ€™s data federation capabilities allow you to compose data from different sources that reside in independent data
stores but are semantically related. This is done by creating a single GraphQL schema from multiple data sources thereby
making the data access process self-serve, allowing you to query, mutate or federate real-time and stream data across
services without writing any custom code.

The remote data sources can either be a table from a [database source](/databases/index.mdx), a GraphQL API added as a
[Remote Schema](/remote-schemas/index.mdx), or a REST API added as an [action](/actions/index.mdx). Once you create
relationships between types from your database tables, Remote Schemas and actions, you can then "join" data across them
by running GraphQL queries.
