# Healthz Check

## Overview

Hasura provides a Health Check endpoint to monitor the status of the GraphQL API. This is available under the
`/healthz` endpoint for all Hasura Projects (including the OSS GraphQL Engine).

The endpoint also optionally accepts a `strict` URL parameter whose value should be either `true` or `false`. When
omitted, the `strict` parameter assumes a `false` value.

## Usage

Make a `GET` request to the `/healthz` endpoint to fetch the status:

```bash
curl -XGET https://advanced-hasura.hasura.app/healthz?strict=false
```

Replace `advanced-hasura` with your project name.

## Response

The returned status could be one of the following:

- `200, OK` - This requires no action. Everything is working as expected.
- If the Metadata contains any inconsistent objects, the response returned will depend on the provided `strict`
  parameter.

  * `strict=false` or omitted: `200, WARN, inconsistent objects in schema`
  * `strict=true`: `500, ERROR, inconsistent objects in schema`

  This requires a review of Metadata since some inconsistent objects have been identified. This usually occurs when
  there has been a `metadata apply`
  [command which contained inconsistent objects](migrations-metadata-seeds/manage-metadata.mdx#apply-metadata).
- `500, ERROR` - This means the API is not working and the
  [logs need to be checked](/deployment/logging.mdx#health-check-log-structure).
