-- Let's consider this query on starwars API:
-- The type `Node` an interface is implemented by `Film`, `Species`, `Planet`,
-- `Person`, `Starship`, `Vehicle`
--
-- query f {
--   node(id: "ZmlsbXM6MQ==") {
--     __typename
--     id
--     ... on Film {
--       title
--     }
--     ... on Species {
--       name
--     }
--   }
-- }
--
-- When we parse this, it gets normalized into this query:
--
-- query f {
--   node(id: "ZmlsbXM6MQ==") {
--     ... on Film {
--       __typename: __typename
--       id
--       title
--     }
--     ... on Species {
--       __typename: __typename
--       id
--       name
--     }
--     ... on Planet {
--       __typename: __typename
--       id
--     }
--     ... on Person {
--       __typename: __typename
--       id
--     }
--     ... on Starship {
--       __typename: __typename
--       id
--     }
--     ... on Vehicle {
--       __typename: __typename
--       id
--     }
--   }
-- }
--
-- `__typename` and `id` get pushed to each of the member types. From the above
-- normalized selection set, we want to costruct a query as close to the
-- original as possible. We do this as follows:
--
-- 1. find the longest common set of fields that each selection set starts with
--    (in the above case, they are `__typename` and `id`)
-- 2. from the above list of fields, find the first field that cannot be
--    defined on the abstract type. The fields that can be defined on the
--    abstract type are all the fields that occur before the first non abstract
--    type field (in the above case, both` __typename` and `id` can be defined
--    on the `Node` type)
-- 3. Strip the base selection set fields from all the member selection sets and
--    filter out the member type selection sets that are subsumed by the base
--    selection set
--
-- The above query now translates to this:
--
-- query f {
--   node(id: "ZmlsbXM6MQ==") {
--     __typename: __typename
--     id
--     ... on Film {
--       title
--     }
--     ... on Species {
--       name
--     }
--   }
-- }
--
-- Note that it is not always possible to get the same shape as the original
-- query and there is more than one approach to this. For example, we could
-- have picked the selection set (that can be defined on the abstract type)
-- that is common across all the member selection sets and used that as the
-- base selection.
