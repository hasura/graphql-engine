# Schema Registry

<ProductBadge standard free standard pro />

## Overview

The Schema Registry, as the name suggests, is a registry which stores all the GraphQL schemas that have existed on your
Hasura project. It is aimed at making your Hasura GraphQL schema changes more reliable, prevent breaking changes in the
schema and to make collaboration across large teams, microservices and roles more manageable and predictable. You can
find the Schema Registry in the settings page of your Hasura Console.

:::info Note

Schema Registry is available on Hasura Cloud from `v2.26.0-cloud.1` and above.

## How it works

Whenever there is any operation on the Hasura Engine that could change the GraphQL schema, Hasura sends an event to the

Schema Registry along with the GraphQL schemas for all defined roles. Operations which could change the GraphQL schema
include:

- Applying new metadata
- Reloading metadata
- Hasura version update

The registry also shows all the changes that went into each role's schema relative to the previous schema registry entry
for that role.

For example, the Schema Registry entry in the screenshot below has schemas for the roles `admin` and `user`. It shows 5
breaking changes, 4 dangerous changes and 1 safe change in the `user` schema. This means that the user schema has
changed in a way which now presents the aforementioned warnings.

If you click to expand a schema, you can see the schema in GraphQL SDL syntax in the `GraphQL` tab. If you click on the
`Changes` tab, you can see all the changes relative to the previous schema for that role.

If there was no previous schema to compare against, there will be no changes to present.

## Kind of schema changes

The changes between subsequent schemas are computed using the open source
[GraphQL Inspector](https://github.com/kamilkisiela/graphql-inspector).

### Breaking changes

Breaking changes are typically the changes that could potentially break your GraphQL operations (queries, mutations or
subscriptions) at the GraphQL operation validation layer.

For example, if a field `name` is removed from a GraphQL object type `user`, that counts as a breaking change as it
could potentially fail an existing GraphQL operation that queries the `name` field in the `user` type.

### Dangerous changes

Sometimes there are changes in your GraphQL schema that might not necessarily break your GraphQL operations at the
validation layer, but might sometimes affect their behaviours.

For example, if a new nullable field is added to an input type, that wouldn't break your GraphQL query but might affect
its execution. These changes are categorised as dangerous changes.

### Safe changes

The GraphQL schema changes that can not affect your existing GraphQL operations are considered to be safe. These changes
typically include new type definitions and new fields in object types.

## Usage

While there can be many use cases for the Schema Registry, it can primarily be used for reliable development, auditing,
and ensuring predictability of your GraphQL schema changes.

As new changes are deployed to a staging or pre-production environment, but before moving to production, you are able to
verify whether all the breaking and dangerous have been accounted for in queries made by clients of your GraphQL API.

Also, if you're using Hasura Cloud for development, you can see the schema changes with every change to your GraphQL
schema and update the corresponding GraphQL queries accordingly.

The Schema Registry can also be used to audit the past schemas of your project and observe when and how certain schema
changes took place.

## Alerts

The Schema Registry provides the following options to configure notifications by clicking the bell icon in the Schema Registry page:

### Email

The Schema Registry sends an email to the **owner** of the project whenever there are any changes in the GraphQL schema of the project.

### Slack

The Schema Registry sends an aggregate summary of GraphQL schema changes to the configured Slack channel of the respective workspace. Follow these steps to configure Slack alerts:

1. Click the "Add to Slack" button in the Slack tab.

   />

2. Select the Slack channel in your workspace in which you want alerts to appear. Click **Allow** to authorize.

3. Slack alerts should be configured for the selected channel in your workspace. You can choose to disable the alerts by clicking on the delete icon.
