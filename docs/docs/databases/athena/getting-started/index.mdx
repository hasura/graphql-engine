# Get Started with Amazon Athena

:::caution Athena Beta Availability

The Hasura Amazon Athena connector is currently available in beta for all Hasura Cloud offerings and for Hasura
Enterprise Edition customers. Once the Athena connector is generally available (GA), it will be available only for
Hasura Cloud Enterprise and Enterprise Edition customers.

:::

:::caution Athena Beta Regions

At this time, Athena access is only available on AWS Regions.

:::

To try Hasura with Amazon Athena, you'll need your own new or existing Amazon Athena database.

Here are 2 ways you can get started with Hasura:

1.  [Hasura Cloud](/databases/athena/getting-started/cloud.mdx) : You'll need to be able to access your Amazon Athena
    service from Hasura Cloud.
2.  [Docker](/databases/athena/getting-started/docker.mdx): Run Hasura with Docker and then connect your Amazon Athena
    service to Hasura.
