# Custom GraphQL types

## Introduction

You can add custom GraphQL types in Hasura that you can utilise for
defining your actions.

:::caution Limitations

It is currently not possible to define `Interfaces` and `Union types` as
custom types

:::

## Object types

The most basic components of a GraphQL schema are object types, which
just represent a kind of object a GraphQL query can return, and what
fields it has. In the GraphQL SDL, we might represent it like this:

```graphql
type UserInfo {
  accessToken: String!
  userId: Int!
}
```

This is an object type called `UserInfo` that has two fields:

-   `accessToken`: This field is of type `String!` (non-nullable
    `String`)
-   `userId`: This field is of type `Int!` (non-nullable `Int`)

From version `v2.2.0` onwards, Hasura GraphQL engine supports nested objects.

For example, you can define a type like the following:

```graphql
type UserInfo {
  accessToken: String!
  userId: Int!
  user: UserObj!
}

type UserObj {
  name: String!
  favFood: String!
  isAdmin: Boolean!
}
```

Recursive nested objects are also supported.

For example, you can use the following type:

```graphql
type UserObj {
  name: String!
  favFood: String!
  isAdmin: Boolean!
  friends: [UserObj]!
}
```

[See reference](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#object-types-and-fields)

### Relationships

Custom object types can be connected to the rest of the graph by setting up 
[action relationships](/graphql/core/databases/postgres/schema/remote-relationships/action-relationships.mdx) with tables/views.

**For example**, given the object type:

```graphql
type UserInfo {
  accessToken: String!
  userId: Int!
}
```

and tables:

```sql
user (id int, name text)
order (id int, user_id int, ...)
```

We can create:

-   an **object relationship** called `loggedInUser` between the
    `UserInfo` object type and the `user` table via the
    `UserInfo.userId` and `user.id` fields.
-   an **array relationship** called `userOrders` between the `UserInfo`
    object type and the `order` table via the `UserInfo.userId` and
    `order.user_id` fields.

The object type will now be modified as:

```graphql {4,5}
type UserInfo {
  accessToken: String!
  userId: Int!
  loggedInUser: user
  userOrders: [order]
}
```

:::info Note

Only fields with non-list scalar types (e.g. `Int`, `String`) can be
used to define relationships

:::

:::caution Limitations

Hasura has the following limitations for relationship in nested object
types:

1.  For nested objects, relationships can only be defined for top-level
    fields. For example, for the following type definition:

    ```graphql
    type UserInfo {
      accessToken: String!
      userId: Int!
      user: UserObj!
    }

    type UserObj {
      name: String!
      favFood: String!
      isAdmin: Boolean!
    }
    ```

    relationships can only be defined using `accessToken` and `userID`,
    you cannot use `name`, `favFood` or `isAdmin` fields in a
    relationship definition.

2.  For `async` actions, you cannot have nested object types and
    relationships in the same action.

:::

## Input types

You can pass complex objects as arguments to queries and mutations. This
is particularly valuable in cases where you might want to pass in a
whole object to be created. In the GraphQL SDL, input types look exactly
the same as regular object types, but with the keyword input instead of
type:

```graphql
input LoginInfo {
  username: String!
  password: String!
}
```

A field of an input type could be a `scalar`, an `enum` or another input
type.

[See reference](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#input-types)

## Scalar types

A GraphQL object type has a name and fields, but at some point those
fields have to resolve to some concrete data. That's where the scalar
types come in: they represent the leaves of the query.

### Inbuilt scalars

Hasura comes with some default GraphQL scalars that you can directly
start using while defining your actions:

-   `Int`: A signed 32‐bit integer.
-   `Float`: A signed double-precision floating-point value.
-   `String`: A UTF‐8 character sequence.
-   `Boolean`: true or false.
-   `ID`: The ID scalar type represents a unique identifier, often used
    to refetch an object or as the key for a cache. The ID type is
    serialized in the same way as a String; however, defining it as an
    ID signifies that it is not intended to be human‐readable.

[See reference](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#scalar-types)

### Custom scalars

Hasura allows you to define custom scalars. For example, if you want to
define a scalar called `Date`, you can define it like.

```graphql
scalar Date
```

These scalars can be used as arguments of queries and mutations or as
fields of object types and input types.

:::info Postgres scalars

Postgres base types are implicitly made available as GraphQL scalars;
there is no need to declare them separately. For example, in the
definition

```graphql
type User {
  id: uuid!
  name: String!
  location: geography
}
```

the `uuid` and `geography` types are assumed to refer to Postgres
scalars (assuming no other definition for them is provided).

:::

## Enum types

Enums are a special kind of scalar that is restricted to a particular
set of allowed values. This allows you to:

-   Validate that any arguments of this type are one of the allowed
    values
-   Communicate through the type system that a field will always be one
    of a finite set of values

Here's what an enum definition might look like in the GraphQL schema
language:

```graphql
enum Color {
  RED
  GREEN
  BLUE
}
```

This means that wherever we use the type `Color` in our schema, we
expect it to be exactly one of RED, GREEN, or BLUE.
