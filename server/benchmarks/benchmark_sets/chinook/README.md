This is the classic [chinook](https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database) data
set, which simulates a simple digital media store; with dozen or so tables,
some simple relationships, and (depending on the table) a few dozen to a few
hundred rows of realistic data per table.

Additionally it has been enriched with some sensible permissions on two new
roles: employee, and customer.

Selected for inclusion because it's understandable, standard, familiar and
somewhat realistic.
