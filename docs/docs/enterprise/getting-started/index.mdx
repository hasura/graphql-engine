# Getting Started

<div className='badge badge--primary heading-badge'>Available on: Enterprise Edition</div>

## Prerequisites

1. Hasura EE can be deployed as a single Docker container and so to install and use this product, you will need a
   container platform (e.g. Docker, Kubernetes, AWS ECS, Google CloudRun, Azure Containers).

2. Hasura EE depends on the following software for its features. We highly recommend using managed instances from your
   cloud or infrastructure provider.

   - **PostgreSQL database (v10 and above)** to store your metadata (just like Hasura CE).
   - **Redis database (v5 and above)**.
