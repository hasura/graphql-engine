## Introduction

The Source Health API is an admin-only endpoint which reports the health of sources whose Health Check is configured.
[Documentation here](/deployment/health-checks/source-health-check.mdx).

## Endpoint

All requests are `GET` requests to the `/healthz/sources` endpoint.

## API Spec

### Request

GET /healthz/sources HTTP/1.1
X-Hasura-Role: admin
```

### Response

The response is an object with the source name as key and health status as value.

```none
{
    "source_1": HealthStatus,
    "source_2": HealthStatus,
     ...        ...
    "source_n": HealthStatus

}
```

The `HealthStatus` is an object with the following members.
