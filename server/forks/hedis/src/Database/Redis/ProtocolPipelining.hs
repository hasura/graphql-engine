-- |A module for automatic, optimal protocol pipelining.
--
--  Protocol pipelining is a technique in which multiple requests are written
--  out to a single socket without waiting for the corresponding responses.
--  The pipelining of requests results in a dramatic improvement in protocol
--  performance.
--
--  [Optimal Pipelining] uses the least number of network packets possible
--
--  [Automatic Pipelining] means that requests are implicitly pipelined as much
--      as possible, i.e. as long as a request's response is not used before any
--      subsequent requests.

--  to call 'hFlush' here. The list constructor '(:)' must be called from
