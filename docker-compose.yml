# This file starts up the necessary database services to test
# graphql-engine.
#
# Run the following to get started:
#
#     docker-compose up -d
#
# That will start up services in the background. To take them down,
# you have to run
#
#     docker-compose down
#
# If you changed DB init scripts, then you should also run:
#
#     docker-compose down --volumes
#
# That'll delete the volumes. Otherwise e.g. PostgreSQL will skip
# initializing if a DB already exists.
#
# If you omit -d, it'll run them all in the foreground, then you can
# stop them with your usual control-C terminal command.
#
# Facts:
#
# * The SERVICE PORTS numbering start at 65001, 65002, etc. to avoid
#   bother existing instances of databases.
#
# * The login credentials are, where possible, all "hasura" to avoid
#   unnecessary mental overhead.
