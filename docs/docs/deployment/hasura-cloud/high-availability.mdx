# High-Availability Configuration

<div className="badge badge--primary heading-badge">Available on: Cloud Standard, Cloud Enterprise</div>

## Overview

Hasura Cloud supports high-availability (HA) configurations for Cloud Standard and Cloud Enterprise projects.

We configure each Cloud Standard and Cloud Enterprise project across different Availability Zones (AZs). In the event of
an incident, our global gateway will ensure traffic is not routed to the affected compute instances while the systems
are auto-recovering.

This redundancy and ability to identify problematic instances provides you with protection against data center power
outages, natural disasters, and other incidents while ensuring your project is performant, handles scaling, and, most
importantly, is available.
