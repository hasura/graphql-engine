-- | Wrap the execution of an HTTP request in a span in the current
-- trace. Despite its name, this function does not start a new trace, and the
-- span will therefore not be recorded if the surrounding context isn't traced
-- (see 'spanWith').
--
-- Additionally, this function adds metadata regarding the request to the
-- created span, and injects the trace context into the HTTP header.
