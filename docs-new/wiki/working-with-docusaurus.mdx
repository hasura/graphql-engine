## Sidebar

### Label & Position

**For Individual Files**

Use of `sidebar_label` and `sidebar_position` frontmatter

```markdown title=graphql/core/actions/create.mdx
---
sidebar_label: Creating actions
sidebar_position: 1
---
```

**For Directories (Categories)**

By default, index.mdx doc's - `sidebar_label` & `sidebar_position` will be applied for directories.

To override, please add a `_category_.json` and add the `label` and `position` properties.

```json title=graphql/core/actions/_category_.json
{
  "label": "Actions",
  "position": 3
}
```

### index.mdx file only directories

This is known and default behavior from docusaurus. `index` is considered direct link to directory index and won't be visible unless there is one more file.

If you only have an index.mdx file, prefer `directory.mdx` over `directory/index.mdx`.


## URL Slug

This only applies for index.mdx files.

index file routes are resolved to `directory/` and not `directory/index`

Use `slug` metadata to manually set the slug to `index`. Please check [this PR on docusaurus](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/5830) for more information.

```markdown title="graphql/core/actions/index.mdx"
---
slug: index
---
```

## Styling

Majority of styles is controlled through css variables - there is a heavy list available (use browser inspect element to see the complete list).

These variables can be overridden and new custom styles to be added in `src/css/custom.scss` and `src/css/_custom-dark.scss` for light and dark themes respectively.

## React Components

Add any new React Components to `src/components/ComponentName` directory. Add `index.tsx` file and use `styles.module.scss` for styling to not let this collide with global styles.

Then this component can be imported with `@site` global directive.

`import ComponentName from '@site/src/components/ComponentName';`

:::tip

Check existing components for a better idea.

## Static Assets

All the static assets lives in `static` directory.

| Asset    | Directory      |
|----------|----------------|
| Images   | `static/img`   |
| Fonts    | `static/fonts` |
| Icons    | `static/icons` |

## Updating to latest Docusaurus Version

Checkout the change log for latest releases and changes involved - https://docusaurus.io/changelog/

Please ensure to check breaking changes and re-swizzle any swizzled components given they are part of breaking changes.

Any [swizzled](https://docusaurus.io/docs/swizzling) component will be cloned to `src/theme`.

**An Example:**
The `TOCInline` and `TOCItems` components are [swizzled](https://docusaurus.io/docs/swizzling) and custom logic is added.

The custom added logic (`src/theme/TOCInline`, `src/theme/TOCItems`) is indicated by comments - `// Customization START` and `// Customization END`. If reswizzled in future only these blocks need an update.

[`toc` is a flat array](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/inline-toc#custom-table-of-contents) and has no concept of nested tree children structure. This behavior is changed in `2.0.0-beta.16`.
Please check the [Breaking changes that forced us to swizzle](https://docusaurus.io/changelog/2.0.0-beta.16#-breaking-change)
