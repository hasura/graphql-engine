# GraphQL Engine Server Configuration

## Introduction

You can customize the configuration of the Hasura GraphQL Engine using either server flags or environment variables.

See the [Server config reference](/deployment/graphql-engine-flags/reference.mdx) for the list of all available flags
and environment variables that can be configured.

## Setting server configurations

### Using flags

You can configure self-hosted Hasura GraphQL Engine instances by setting flags on the `graphql-engine` command and the
`serve` sub-command.

#### The `graphql-engine` command

The `graphql-engine` command has a limited number of flags and environment variables; these pertain directly to the
databases used in your project.

Every `graphql-engine` command is structured as:

```bash
$ graphql-engine <server-flags>
```

As an example, we can set the metadata database url for a project using a flag:

```bash
$ graphql-engine --metadata-database-url "postgres://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<db-name>"
```

#### The `serve` sub-command

The `serve` sub-command provides opportunities to further customize Hasura's configuration.

Building on the previous example, we can set the port by which Hasura is served by pairing the `serve` sub-command with
the `--port` flag and assigning a value:

```bash
$ graphql-engine --metadata-database-url "postgres://user:password@host:port/db-name" serve --port 3000
```

:::info Note

The following options can be configured via flags _only_:

```none
    --host                      Postgres server host
-p, --port                      Postgres server port
-u, --user                      Database user name
-p, --password                  Password of the user
-d, --dbname                    Database name to connect to
-o, --pg-connection-options     PostgreSQL connection options
```

All other flags can also be passed as environment variables.

### Using environment variables

You can also use environment variables to configure the Hasura GraphQL Engine. As an example, if you're using
[Docker on a self-hosted instance](/deployment/deployment-guides/docker.mdx), you can set these values by modifying your
`docker-compose.yaml` file used to run Hasura:

```yaml
# docker-compose.yaml

version: '3.6'
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:12
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - db_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgrespassword
  graphql-engine:
    image: hasura/graphql-engine:v2.15.0
    ports:
      - '8080:8080'
    depends_on:
      - 'postgres'
    restart: always
    # highlight-start
    environment:
      ## postgres database to store Hasura metadata
      HASURA_GRAPHQL_METADATA_DATABASE_URL: postgres://postgres:postgrespassword@postgres:5432/postgres
      ## this env var can be used to add the above postgres database to Hasura as a data source. this can be removed/updated based on your needs
      PG_DATABASE_URL: postgres://postgres:postgrespassword@postgres:5432/postgres
      ## enable the console served by server
      HASURA_GRAPHQL_ENABLE_CONSOLE: 'true' # set to "false" to disable console
      ## enable debugging mode. It is recommended to disable this in production
      HASURA_GRAPHQL_DEV_MODE: 'true'
      HASURA_GRAPHQL_ENABLED_LOG_TYPES: startup, http-log, webhook-log, websocket-log, query-log
      ## uncomment next line to run console offline (i.e load console assets from server instead of CDN)
      # HASURA_GRAPHQL_CONSOLE_ASSETS_DIR: /srv/console-assets
      ## uncomment next line to set an admin secret
      # HASURA_GRAPHQL_ADMIN_SECRET: myadminsecretkey
      # highlight-end
volumes:
  db_data:
```

Alternatively, if you're using Hasura Cloud, you can set and add environment variables from a project's dashboard:

:::info Note

When the equivalent flags for environment variables are used, the flags will take precedence.

## Use cases

The following are a few configuration use cases:

- [Add an admin secret](/deployment/graphql-engine-flags/config-examples.mdx#add-admin-secret)
- [Using CLI commands with admin secret](/deployment/graphql-engine-flags/config-examples.mdx#cli-with-admin-secret)
- [Configure CORS](/deployment/graphql-engine-flags/config-examples.mdx#configure-cors)
- [Run console offline (i.e load console assets from server instead of CDN)](/deployment/graphql-engine-flags/config-examples.mdx#console-assets-on-server)
- [Dev (debugging) mode](/deployment/graphql-engine-flags/config-examples.mdx#dev-mode)
- [Add a metadata database](/deployment/graphql-engine-flags/config-examples.mdx#add-metadata-database)
