# Get Started with Snowflake

:::caution Snowflake Beta Availability

The Hasura Snowflake connector is currently available in `beta` for all Hasura Cloud offerings and for Hasura
Enterprise Edition customers. Once the Snowflake connector is generally available (GA), it will be available only for
Hasura Cloud Enterprise and Enterprise Edition customers.

:::

:::caution Snowflake Beta Regions

At this time, Snowflake access is only available on AWS Regions.

:::

To try Hasura with Snowflake, you'll need a new or existing Snowflake database.

Here are 2 ways you can get started with Hasura and Snowflake:

1.  [Hasura Cloud](/databases/snowflake/getting-started/cloud.mdx) : You'll need to be able to access your Snowflake
    service from Hasura Cloud.
2.  [Docker](/databases/snowflake/getting-started/docker.mdx): Run Hasura with Docker and then connect your Snowflake
    service to Hasura.
