# Using AWS Cognito for authentication

## Introduction

In this guide, we will walk through how to set up AWS Cognito to work
with the Hasura GraphQL engine.

## Set up user pools and hosted web UI

Follow [these instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/getting-started-with-cognito-user-pools.html)
to set up a user pool, add an app and enable the hosted web UI in AWS
cognito. While enabling the hosted web UI, you need to select the
checkbox `Implicit Grant`.

## Create a lambda function to add claims to the JWT

To add custom claims to the JWT, we need to create a lambda function and
configure AWS cognito to invoke this lambda function before generating a
token.

-   Go to [AWS Lambda home](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home)
    and click on the `Create Function` button to create a new lambda
    function
-   Add the following code for the `Function Code`

```javascript
exports.handler = (event, context, callback) => {
    event.response = {
        "claimsOverrideDetails": {
            "claimsToAddOrOverride": {
                "https://hasura.io/jwt/claims": JSON.stringify({
                    "x-hasura-user-id": event.request.userAttributes.sub,
                    "x-hasura-default-role": "user",
                    // do some custom logic to decide allowed roles
                    "x-hasura-allowed-roles": ["user"],
                })
            }
        }
    }
    callback(null, event)
}
```

## Configure Cognito to trigger the lambda function

In cognito, select `Triggers` -> `Pre Token Generation` and choose the
lambda function created above:

## Test the Cognito login and generate sample JWTs for testing

You don't need to integrate your UI with Cognito for testing. You can
follow the steps below:

1.  Launch the hosted UI from AWS Cognito.

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/graphql/core/guides/cognito-launch-hosted-ui.png"
  alt="Launch Cognito Login UI"
/>

2.  You should see the Cognito login page where you can log in or sign
    up.

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/graphql/core/guides/cognito-login.png"
  alt="Cognito Login Page"
/>


<div id="test-cognito" />

3. After successfully logging in, you will be redirected to
`https://localhost:3000/cognito-callback#id_token=xxxxxx&yyyyyy`. This
page may be a 404 if you don't have a UI running on localhost:3000.
Extract the `id_token` value from this URL.

4.  To test this JWT, and to see if all the Hasura claims are added as
    per the sections above, let's test this out with
    [jwt.io](https://jwt.io)!

  alt="JWT debug on jwt.io"
/>

**Save this JWT token value so that we can use it later to test the
authorization using the Hasura console.**

## Configure Hasura to use Cognito keys

Cognito publishes their JWK under:

`https://cognito-idp.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com/<user-pool-id>/.well-known/jwks.json`

While starting Hasura, set the environmental variable
`HASURA_GRAPHQL_JWT_SECRET` or the flag `--jwt-secret` to the below
JSON:

```javascript
{
"type":"RS256",
"jwk_url": "https://cognito-idp.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com/<user-pool-id>/.well-known/jwks.json",
"claims_format": "stringified_json"
}
```

## Add access control rules via the Hasura console

Cognito is configured and ready to be used in the application. You can
now set up access control rules that will automatically get applied
whenever a client makes a GraphQL request with the Cognito token.

Refer to [Access control basics](/graphql/core/auth/authorization/basics.mdx) for more information.

To test this out, add an access control rule that uses
`x-hasura-user-id` for the role `user`. Then make a GraphQL query or a
mutation, with the authorization token from the
[previous step](#test-cognito) where we generated an Cognito token.

You can also use the env variable `HASURA_GRAPHQL_UNAUTHORIZED_ROLE` or
`--unauthorized-role` flag to set a role for **unauthorized users**
(e.g. `anonymous`). This will allow you to set permissions for users
that are not logged in.

The configured unauthorized role will be used whenever an access token
is not present in a request to the GraphQL API.

This can be useful for data that you would like anyone to be able to
access and can be configured and restricted just like any other role.

## Sync users from Cognito

Now that you can sign up/log in using Cognito, you will need a way to
sync your users in Postgres as well. All you really need is the Cognito
`user_id` in something like a `users` table.

This can be done creating a lambda function and configuring it as the
`Post Authentication Trigger`. The parameters available for this trigger
are described [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-lambda-post-authentication.html)
. Here is a sample lambda function:

```javascript
function (event, context, callback) {
  const userId = event.userName;
  const hasuraAdminSecret = "xxxx";
  const url = "https://my-hasura-app.hasura.app/v1/graphql";
  const upsertUserQuery = `
    mutation($userId: String!){
      insert_users(objects: [{ id: $userId }], on_conflict: { constraint: users_pkey, update_columns: [] }) {
        affected_rows
      }
    }`
  const graphqlReq = { "query": upsertUserQuery, "variables": { "userId": userId } }

  request.post({
      headers: {'content-type' : 'application/json', 'x-hasura-admin-secret': hasuraAdminSecret},
      url:   url,
      body:  JSON.stringify(graphqlReq)
  }, function(error, response, body){
       console.log(body);
       callback(null, user, context);
  });
}
```

That’s it! This lambda function will be triggered on every successful
sign up/log in and sync your Cognito user into your Postgres database.

:::info Note

We need to use an `upsert` operation here because social logins do not
distinguish between sign up and login. Hence, we need to run this rule
every time a successful login is made and do nothing if the user already
exists.

:::

:::info Local dev with Cognito rules

The sync step will require a reachable endpoint to Hasura and this is
not possible in localhost. You can use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) or
similar services to expose your locally running Hasura with a public
endpoint temporarily.
