title: "Apollo Subscription Component"

The easiest way to bring live data to your UI is using the Smart Subscription from vue-apollo. Each subscription declared in the apollo.$subscribe option in a component results in the creation of a smart subscription object.

One thing to note, subscriptions are just listeners, they donâ€™t request any data when first connected, but only open up a connection to get new data.
