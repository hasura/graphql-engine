# Postgres indexes

## Introduction

[Postgres indexes](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createindex.html)
are a way of increasing query performance based on columns that are
queried frequently. The concept is similar to the one of an index in a
book. It helps accessing the data you're looking for more quickly by
maintaining additional metadata.

:::info Note

Learn more about indexes in the [Postgres documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createindex.html).

## Example

**Create an index on the column name in the table authors:**

Let's say the database receives a large number of requests of authors
being queried by their name, for example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM authors WHERE name = 'J.K. Rowling';
```

We can now create an index on the `name` column of the `authors` table:

```sql
CREATE INDEX author_name_index ON authors (name);
```

Since the database is now able to look up the result of these queries
more quickly, the performance of these queries will increase
significantly.

## Postgres indexes & Hasura

Indexes can be used to optimize query performance in Hasura.
[Refer to this page](/graphql/core/databases/postgres/queries/performance.mdx#pg-data-validation-pg-indexes) for information
about query performance and how to add Postgres indexes to Hasura.
