Access control basics

In this section, we're going to set up a simple access control rule for restricting querying on a table.
We're working with a simple ``author`` table where users have some information stored about themselves.

Create a table
--------------

Head to your console and :ref:`create a table <create-tables>` called ``author`` with the following schema:

.. code-block:: sql

  author (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT
  )

Now, insert some sample data into the table using the ``Insert Row`` tab of the ``author`` table.

Try out a query
---------------

Head to the ``GraphiQL`` tab in your console and try out the below query:

.. code-block:: graphql

  query {
    author {
      id
      name
    }
  }

You'll see that this results in a response that contains all the authors because by default the GraphQL query is
accepted with **admin** permissions.

Add a simple access control rule for a logged in user
-----------------------------------------------------

Let's say that we want to restrict users to fetch only their own data.

Head to the ``Permissions`` tab of the ``author`` table.

Now add a ``select`` access control rule for the ``user`` role on the ``author`` table:

.. image:: ../../../img/graphql/manual/auth/author-select-perms.png

This rule reads as:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 25 20 45

   * - Definition
     - Condition
     - Representation

   * - allow user to access only their own row
     - ``id`` in the row is equal to ``user-id`` from the request session variable
     -
       .. code-block:: json

          {
            "id": {
              "_eq": "X-Hasura-User-Id"
            }
          }

Now, let's make the same query as above but also include two dynamic authorization variables ``X-Hasura-Role`` and
``X-Hasura-User-Id`` via request headers. These will automatically get used according to the permission rule we set up.

You can notice above how the same query now only includes the right slice of data.

.. admonition:: Defining access control rules

  Access control, or permission rules can be as complex as you need them to be, even using a nested object's
  fields if required. You can use the same operators that you use to filter query results to define
  permission rules. See :doc:`filtering query results <../queries/query-filters>` for more details.

  For example, for an ``article`` table with a nested ``author`` table, we can define the select permission as:

  .. code-block:: json

    {
      "_and":
        [
          {
            "published_on": { "_gt": "31-12-2018" }
          },
          {
            "author": {
              "id": { "_eq": "X-Hasura-User-Id" }
            }
          }
        ]
      }

  This rule reads as: allow selecting an article if it was published after "31-12-2018" and its author is the current
  user.

  **Note:** The operators ``_has_keys_all`` and ``_has_keys_any`` are currently not supported in permission rules

.. _restrict_columns:

Restrict access to certain columns
----------------------------------

We can restrict the columns of a table that a particular role has access to.

Head to the ``Permissions`` tab of the table and edit the ``Select`` permissions for the role:

.. image:: ../../../img/graphql/manual/auth/restrict-columns.png

.. _limit_rows:

Limit number of rows returned in a single request
-------------------------------------------------

We can set a hard limit on the maximum number of rows that will be returned in a single request for a table for a particular role.

Head to the ``Permissions`` tab of the table and edit the ``Select`` permissions for the role:
