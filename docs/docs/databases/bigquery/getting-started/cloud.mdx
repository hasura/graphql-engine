# Getting started with BigQuery with Hasura Cloud

Navigate to
[cloud.hasura.io](https://cloud.hasura.io/signup/?pg=docs&plcmt=body&cta=navigate-to-cloud-hasura-io&tech=default), and
create a new Hasura Cloud account.

Once you create a project on Hasura Cloud, hit the "Launch Console" button to open the Hasura Console for your project.

## Connecting to a BigQuery project

### Pre-requisites

Hasura GraphQL Engine requires the following to connect to a BigQuery project:

- The [project Id](https://support.google.com/googleapi/answer/7014113?hl=en)
- The [datasets](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/datasets-intro) that can be exposed over graphql have to be
explicitly listed.
- A [Service Account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts) to query the project.

### Creating a Service Account

- In Google Cloud's console, head to your BigQuery project.

- Go to `IAM & Admin > Service Accounts > Create Service Account`

           width='400px' />

- Give it a name, and under roles, and grant these 3 roles:
  - `BigQuery Metadata Viewer`
  - `BigQuery Data Viewer`
  - `BigQuery Job User`

- Click on the created service account, `Keys > ADD KEY > Create New Key > JSON > Create`. This will download a service
account file on your computer.

### Connect BigQuery to Hasura

- Update Graphql Engine with an environment variable set to the contents of the service account.

- Head to the console, in the `Connect Existing Database` page, choose `Environment Variable` under `Connect Via`, and
fill in the necessary details:

You should now be able to track the tables that are part of the specified tables and configure relationships between
them. As BigQuery lacks foreign key constraints, the Hasura Console cannot suggest relationships, so all relationships between
BigQuery tables have to be manually configured.

## Try out a GraphQL query

Head to the `API` tab in the Console and try running a GraphQL query! Use the explorer sidebar on GraphQL to get help in
creating a GraphQL query.
