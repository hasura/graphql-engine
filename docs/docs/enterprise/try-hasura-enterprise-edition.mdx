# Try Hasura Enterprise Edition

<ProductBadge self />

## Introduction

Trying and evaluating Hasura Enterprise features with your current Hasura setup is now easier and self-serve. Starting
with Hasura GraphQL Engine version `v2.23.0`, you can get started with your 30-day Enterprise Edition Trial in
**under a minute**!

During your trial period you will have access to all the [Enterprise Edition features](/enterprise/overview.mdx) to
help you successfully evaluate Hasura Enterprise for your use case.

:::info Note

- The `hasura/graphql-engine` image includes both open-source and proprietary components. The open-source portions are
  licensed under the [Apache License, Version 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0). The proprietary
  components include features for Hasura Enterprise and are enabled with a license provided by Hasura. If you would like
  to use an image with only the open source components, please use Docker images on
  [this page](https://hub.docker.com/r/hasura/graphql-engine/tags?page=1&name=-ce) that contain `-ce`. (example:
  `hasura/graphql-engine:2.23-ce`)

- Use of a Hasura Enterprise Edition Trial is only recommended for evaluation during the trial period and not for
  production use.

- Supported in `v2.23.0` onwards.

- Your Hasura instance must be connected to the internet to use the Hasura Enterprise Edition Trial. If you are running Hasura in an airgap environment, please [contact Hasura Sales](mailto:sales@hasura.io) to get a license key for trying Hasura Enterprise.

:::

## Activate your Enterprise Edition Trial

### Step 1. Run Hasura

You can run Hasura instances in a container environment of your choice. Please follow this
[guide for getting started](getting-started/quickstart-docker.mdx), which describes how to install Hasura GraphQL Engine using
Docker.

If you are already running Hasura inside a Docker container with open-source features, then you just need to change the
Docker container tag to `v2.23.0` or above and then redeploy the container.

> Please make sure that your `docker-compose.yaml` does not have the `HASURA_GRAPHQL_EE_LICENSE_KEY` environment variable set. If you already have a license key, you can try Hasura Enterprise directly by following instructions [here](upgrade-ce-to-ee.mdx).

### Step 2. Register for your 30-day free Trial

Once Hasura is running, you can register for an Enterprise Edition Trial using the Hasura Console. In the Hasura
Console, click on the `Enterprise` button in the top right and fill out the registration form.

Filling out this form will automatically create a Hasura Cloud account. **If you already have an existing Hasura Cloud
account, please use the same credentials in the form**. You can use the same Hasura Cloud account to centrally manage
all your enterprise licenses (this feature to be added soon).

Please see the [FAQ](#frequently-asked-questions) section in case you are facing issues with registration.

### Step 3. Restart your container

Once you have registered for the Enterprise Edition Trial, restart your Hasura GraphQL Engine instance. This is
required only once.

Example:

```bash
docker-compose restart graphql-engine
```

Now, refresh the Hasura Console and you're all set to explore Hasura Enterprise Edition 🎉

To view all Enterprise Edition features you've just enabled, click the `EE` button in the navigation bar.
Conveniently, this also displays the number of days remaining in your trial period.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### I registered for the trial but I can't see the Enterprise Edition features. Where are they?

If you have already registered, please restart your Docker container once.

### I restarted my Hasura Docker container but I still can't see Enterprise Edition features. What should I do?

Please try registering for the trial again by filling out the registration form, in case previous registration attempt
failed due to some reason. If the issue persists, please [contact us](https://hasura.io/contact-us-eetrial) and we'll be
happy to help you.

### I need some more time to explore Enterprise Edition; how can I extend my Trial license?

Please [contact us](https://hasura.io/contact-us-eetrial) and our team will assist you.

### Will the Enterprise Edition Trial work for a multiple-replica setup of Hasura?

Yes, you would need to register once, and all the replicas of your Hasura backed by same metadata database will have
Enterprise Edition features enabled.

### I am already in an Enterprise Edition evaluation period; how can I continue evaluation with a different Hasura
environment?

In your new Hasura instance, open the Console and click on `Enterprise`. Then, select `Activate Existing License`.
Please enter the same credentials you used for the initial Trial registration. Restart Hasura and now the same Trial
license will be applied to this new instance too.

### Why do I need to enter a password to register for a Trial?

As you register for the Enterprise Edition Trial, we use the email and password to create a Hasura Cloud account. This
will be used for verification and also help manage your Enterprise licenses in the future (this feature to be added
soon).

### I forgot the password with which I registered; how do I enable the Trial now?

Please head to [Hasura Cloud](https://cloud.hasura.io/login) and click on 'Forgot?' to recover your password. Please use
the updated password to register for the Enterprise Edition Trial.

### I use an OAuth login on Hasura Cloud; how do I register for an Enterprise Edition Trial?

You can register for a Trial with same email, but a new password. Your Hasura Cloud account will be updated with the new
password.

### I use SSO on Hasura Cloud to login; how do I enable an Enterprise Edition Trial?

Please register with a different email or [contact us](https://hasura.io/contact-us-eetrial) if you want to continue
with the same email. We will add support for SSO users in future.

### What kind of data does Hasura collect during an Enterprise Edition Trial?

[This guide](/policies/telemetry.mdx) elaborates on the data collected by Hasura in line with the
[Hasura privacy policy](https://hasura.io/legal/hasura-privacy-policy/).
