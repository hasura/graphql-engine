Introduction
------------

If you have a coupon, you can redeem it from the dashboard to get a credit waiver on your next invoice. Discounts will be adjusted while creating the invoice.

Redeem a coupon
---------------

Navigate to the ``Billing`` tab, click on ``Coupons and Credits``, enter the code and click on the redeem button. Only one coupon is applied.

.. note::

   If there is an active coupon and another coupon is applied, then the later coupon is used.
