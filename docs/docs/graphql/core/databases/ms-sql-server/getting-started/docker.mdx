# Get Started with Docker (Hasura & MS SQL Server)

## Try it out

### Pre-requisites

-   [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)
-   [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
-   An existing SQL Server database

### Step 1: Get the docker-compose file

Get the Hasura MS SQL Server docker compose file:

```bash
# in a new directory run
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hasura/graphql-engine/master/install-manifests/docker-compose-ms-sql-server/docker-compose.yaml
# or run
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hasura/graphql-engine/master/install-manifests/docker-compose-ms-sql-server/docker-compose.yaml -o docker-compose.yaml
```

### Step 2: Run Hasura GraphQL engine

The following command will run Hasura along with a Postgres database required
for its functioning.

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
```

Check if the containers are running:

```bash
$ docker ps

CONTAINER ID IMAGE                 ... CREATED STATUS PORTS          ...
097f58433a2b hasura/graphql-engine ... 1m ago  Up 1m  8080->8080/tcp ...
b0b1aac0508d postgres              ... 1m ago  Up 1m  5432/tcp       ...

Please do note that you will see a Postgres database running, which is used by Hasura to store its configuration (Hasura metadata).
```

### Step 3: Open the Hasura console

Head to `http://localhost:8080/console` to open the Hasura console.

### Step 4: Add your SQL Server database as a source to Hasura

Head to the `Data > Manage databases` section on the console to add
your MS SQL Server as a source to Hasura. You'll need your ODBC connection string. Make sure that 
your ODBC driver is set to version 17.

Here are 2 examples of what your connection strings might look like:

- Testing with SQL Server running locally on Mac:<br/>
     Driver={ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server};Server=tcp:<b>host.docker.internal</b>,<b>1433</b>;Database=<b>tempdb</b>;Uid=<b>sa</b>;Pwd=<b>Password123</b>;

-  A SQL Server instance on Azure SQL Serverless:<br/>
      Driver={ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server};Server=tcp:<b>db.hostname.com</b>,<b>1433</b>;Database=<b>db-name</b>;Uid=<b>username</b>;Pwd=<b>password</b>;Encrypt=yes;TrustServerCertificate=no;Connection Timeout=30;

If you're testing Hasura with SQL Server running locally, [read this guide](/graphql/core/guides/docker-networking.mdx) on Docker networking in case you're not sure 
how to make sure that your SQL Server database is reachable from the Hasura docker container on Linux, Mac or Windows.

   width="1000px"
/>

Once you add the database, you'll see your database pop up on the sidebar.

### Step 5: Option 1: Track existing tables

If you have existing tables, head to the database page by clicking on the database name on the sidebar. You should see a list of tables.

   alt="Manage my-db"
   width="1000px"
/>

Track tables selectively or all of them so that Hasura can introspect the tables and create the corresponding GraphQL schema.

   alt="Track tables"
   width="1000px"
/>

If you have foreign keys, you'll also see suggested relationships. Again, you can choose to track them selectively or all at once.

   width="1000px"
/>

### Step 5: Option 2: Create new tables

If you don't have existing tables, head to the Run SQL window
to run SQL against your SQL Server database and create tables or hit the Create Table button 
to create a table.

If you're running raw SQL queries to create your tables, Don't forget to check "track metadata"
at the bottom of the Run SQL window to make sure Hasura tracks your new database objects 
in its GraphQL schema.

   width="1000px"

### Step 6: Try out a GraphQL query

Head to the `API` tab in the console and try running a GraphQL query! Use the explorer sidebar on GraphQL to get help in creating a GraphQL query.

## Keep up to date

Hasura supports queries, subscriptions, relationships and permissions on MS SQL Server.

Please watch this space to get the latest docs on how you can try these features out via the console or by manipulating metadata in JSON/YAML directly.
