# Creating a Hasura Seed data Migration

## Use case

It's often useful to add some initial Seed data into your database as part of the initialization process, with
Hasura Seeds you can do that. This is particularly useful for adding a testing user or to pre-populate values if you
have set a table in Hasura as an enum table to expose it as GraphQL enums in the GraphQL API.

## Create a Hasura Seed file

You can use the Hasura CLI to automatically create Seed files for you based on the data which is already in a table
in a database.

```bash
hasura seed create myAuthorsSeed --from-table author
```

Select the database containing the table you've specified.

```text
? Select a database to use
```

CLI will log

```text
INFO created seed file successfully     file=/Users/me/myDemoProject/seeds/default/1656499378904_myAuthorsSeed.sql
```

If you open the file created you will see standard pure SQL insert statements with the data contained in the database.
Eg:

```sql
SET check_function_bodies = false;
INSERT INTO public.author (id, name) VALUES ('1', 'Woolf');
INSERT INTO public.author (id, name) VALUES ('2', 'Tolkien');
INSERT INTO public.author (id, name) VALUES ('3', 'Austen');
INSERT INTO public.author (id, name) VALUES ('4', 'Orwell');
```

## Apply a Hasura Seed file

To apply a seeds file to your Hasura instance you can use the `apply` Hasura CLI command. Eg:

```bash
hasura seed apply --file 1656499378904_myNewAuthorsSeed.sql
```

If you do not specify a database with the `--database-name` flag then the CLI will prompt you to choose the database
to apply the seeds to and as long as there are no conflicts and the SQL executes successfully to input the data then
the CLI will log:

```text
INFO Seeds planted
```

Success!
