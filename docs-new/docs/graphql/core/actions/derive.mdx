# Deriving actions

## Introduction

It is a typical requirement to run some custom business logic before
actually executing a mutation / query, for example, to perform
validations or to enrich some data from an external source. Actions can
be used to achieve this.

To help with creation of such actions, Hasura lets you derive an action
from an existing query or mutation by:

-   Auto-generating the GraphQL types defining the action
-   Generating the handler code to delegate the action back to the
    original query or mutation after executing some business logic

## Generate derived action GraphQL types

Hasura can generate the relevant GraphQL types required to define an
action given a GraphQL operation.

For example, let's say we would like to derive an action from the
mutation:

```graphql
mutation insertAuthor {
  insert_author_one(
    object: {
      name: "Some name"
    }) {
    id
    name
  }
}
```

As the derived action will need to accept some arguments, we can convert
the above mutation to use variables instead which can then become
arguments to our derived action.

```graphql
mutation insertAuthor($name: String) {
  insert_author_one(
    object: {
      name: $name
    }) {
    id
    name
  }
}
```

Now that we have a mutation with arguments being accepted as variables,
we can derive our action:

<Tabs className="api-tabs">
<TabItem value="console" label="Console">

Head to the `GraphiQL` tab of the console and paste / generate your
query in the GraphiQL window.

Next hit the `Derive action` button as shown below:

  alt="Console derive action button"
/>

This will redirect you to the `Add a new action` page with the action
definition auto filled.

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/graphql/core/actions/actions-derive-types.png"
  alt="Console derived action types"
/>

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

To create the derived action, run:

```bash
hasura actions create insertAuthor --derive-from 'mutation insertAuthor($name: String) {
     insert_author_one(
       object: {
         name: $name
     }) {
     id
     name
   }
 }'
```

This will open up an editor with `metadata/actions.graphql` with the
following action types auto filled.

```graphql
type Mutation {
  insertAuthor (
    name: String
  ): InsertAuthorOutput
}

type InsertAuthorOutput {
   id : Int!
   name : String!
}
```

:::info Note

The action name will be picked up from the argument of the command and
not the mutation string.

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

:::info Note

-   The derived output type will be derived from the actual output type
    of the original query or mutation and not the selection-set of the
    given query or mutation string.
-   As currently custom object types can only have scalar / enum fields
    any object type fields in the original output type will be dropped
    in the derived output type.

## Generate handler code for a derived action

For a derived action, Hasura can generate the relevant handler code to
delegate the action back to the original operation.


<Tabs className="api-tabs">
<TabItem value="console" label="Console">


Head to the `Actions -> [action-name] -> Codegen` tab in the console

You can select the framework of your choice to get the corresponding
handler boilerplate code.

  alt="Console derived action codegen"
/>

:::info Note

The information about derived actions are stored locally on the browser
and hence it is currently only possible to generate the delegation code
from the browser where the action was created.

:::

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">

You will have to set up codegen in the CLI first to do this as explained
in [Generating handler code for your action](/graphql/core/actions/codegen/index.mdx#actions-codegen-execute)

After saving the GraphQL types generated by the actions create command
in the previous section, the CLI will prompt you if you would like to
generate the corresponding codegen files. Hit <em>y</em> to generate the codegen files with the
delegation logic.

The CLI does not persist information about derived actions. Hence if you
wish to generate the delegation code, you might want to pass the query
or mutation string while running the codegen command:

```bash
hasura actions codegen <action-name> --derive-from '<query/mutation string>'
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Hiding the original mutation in the API

Once a mutation is derived, you might want to hide it from your public
GraphQL API but still want to use it from your action handler.

To achieve this you can mark the mutation as `backend_only` so that it
can be accessed only via "trusted sources". See
[Backend only](/graphql/core/auth/authorization/permission-rules.mdx#backend-only-permissions) for more details

:::info Note

Setting `backend-only` is currently available for insert mutations only.
