# Postgres: Distinct query results

## The **distinct_on** argument

You can fetch rows with only distinct values of a column using the
`distinct_on` argument.

It is typically recommended to use `order_by` along with `distinct_on`
to ensure we get predictable results *(otherwise any arbitrary row with
a distinct value of the column may be returned)*. Note that the
`distinct_on` column needs to be the first column in the `order_by`
expression. See [sort queries](/graphql/core/databases/postgres/queries/sorting.mdx) for more info on
using `order_by`.

```graphql
employees (
  distinct_on: [employees_select_column]
  order_by: [employees_order_by]
): [employees]!

# select column enum type for "employees" table
enum employees_select_column {
  id
  name
  department
  salary
}
```

You can see the complete specification of the `distinct_on` argument in
the [API reference](/graphql/core/api-reference/graphql-api/query.mdx#distinctonexp).

## Fetch results with distinct values of a particular field

**For example**, fetch the employee with the highest salary from each
department:

<GraphiQLIDE
  query={`query {
  employees (
    distinct_on: [department]
    order_by: [
      {department: asc},
      {salary: desc}
    ]
  ) {
    id
    name
    department
    salary
  }
}`}
response={`{
 "data": {
   "employees": [
     {
       "id": 5,
       "name": "Kamila",
       "department": "Engineering",
       "salary": 4325
     },
     {
       "id": 4,
       "name": "Damien",
       "department": "Product",
       "salary": 3124
     },
     {
       "id": 7,
       "name": "Rickard",
       "department": "Services",
       "salary": 2223
     }
   ]
 }
}`}
/>
