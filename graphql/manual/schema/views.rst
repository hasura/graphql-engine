Customise schema with views
===========================

You may want to customise your GraphQL schema for reasons like:

- Limited scope: expose only a subset of the columns in a table
- Support aggregations (*like count, average, etc.*) in queries

Please see the following documentation on how to support these use-cases using views:

- :doc:`Control Access to data using views <../queries/control-access>`

- :doc:`Support aggregations using views <../queries/aggregations>`
