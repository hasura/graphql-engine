Getting Started
===============

Let's build a simple clone of the popular publishing platform `medium <https://medium.com/>`_ and use that to learn about the features provided by the Hasura platform. Our clone, called ``ether`` will have the following features:

#. Users can publish posts, like and comment
#. Anyone can view published posts, overall likes and comments

   You can also follow a roughly equivalent version of this getting started guide as a video series:
