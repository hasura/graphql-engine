Auth webhook samples
====================

We have put together a `GitHub Node.js repo <https://github.com/hasura/sample-auth-webhook>`__ that has some sample auth
webhooks configured.

You can deploy these samples using `glitch <https://glitch.com/>`__:

  :target: http://glitch.com/edit/#!/import/github/hasura/sample-auth-webhook

Once deployed, you can use any of the following endpoints as your auth webhook in the GraphQL engine:

- ``/simple/webhook``   (`View source <https://github.com/hasura/sample-auth-webhook/blob/master/server.js#L25>`__)
- ``/firebase/webhook``  (`View source <https://github.com/hasura/sample-auth-webhook/tree/master/firebase>`__)
- ``/auth0/webhook`` (`View source <https://github.com/hasura/sample-auth-webhook/tree/master/auth0>`__)

.. note::

    If you are using ``auth0`` or ``firebase`` you will have to set the associated environment variables.
