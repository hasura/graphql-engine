Error: the aggregate expression Int4_aggregate_exp (in subgraph default) specifies an aggregation function '_sum' which is mapped to the data connector 'mypg (in subgraph default)' but the Open DD return type Int4! (in subgraph default) is not compatible with the data connector's return type. Reason: The data connector's return scalar type representation (Int8 (in subgraph default)) does not match the Open DD return type
