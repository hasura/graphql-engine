{- NOTE [Compression Heuristics]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Compression is a significant source of CPU usage (and latency for small
requests); let's be smarter about compression when we have the option.

Some data from cloud (omitting healthz and version), with zlib gzip at
compression level 1:

   ~96% of requests can accept gzip responses

   P50(uncompressed_response_size) :     150 bytes
   P75(uncompressed_response_size) :    1200 bytes
   P95(uncompressed_response_size) :   39000 bytes
   P99(uncompressed_response_size) :   95000 bytes

   Responses smaller than 700 bytes (the common case)...
       ...account for  4% of total response egress (currently)
       ...account for 68% of responses

       ...have a P50 compression ratio of: 1.0  (i.e. no benefit)
       ...     a P75 compression ratio of: 1.3
       ...     a P99 compression ratio of: 2.0

   ...and FYI if we take a cutoff of...
       ...2000 we get P50 ratio 0.9
       ...5000 we get P50 ratio 0.8

Note [Compression ratios]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I did some measurements of compression ratios at `gzip -1` (libc) of some
randomly generated json, real json datasets, and output from our benchmarked
chinook queries:

    2552/6131    = 0.41
    4666/8718    = 0.53
    13921/27131  = 0.51
    5895/8879    = 0.66  <----- completely random strings
    8634/28261   = 0.30
    70422/372466 = 0.18

    200/600      = 0.33  <----| from chinook graphql benchmarks
    3000/33000   = 0.09  <----|
    13000/190000 = 0.07  <----'

Given these numbers I would suggest using a rule-of-thumb expected compression
ratio between 2:1 and 10:1, depending on what being conservative means in the
context.

I didn't test higher compression levels much, but `gzip -4` for the most part
resulted in less than 10% smaller output on random json, and ~30% on our highly
compressible benchmark output.

UPDATE (12/5):
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some recent data on compression ratios for graphql responsed (here as:
compressed_size / uncompressed_size) taken from cloud:

Aggregate across all responses where uncompressed > 700 bytes:

    max:    0.891 (worst compression)
    p99:    0.658
    p95:    0.565
    p75:    0.467
    p50:    0.346
    min:    0.005 (best compression)

Aggregate across responses where uncompressed > 17K bytes (90th percentile):

    max:    0.773
    p99:    0.414
    p95:    0.304
    p75:    0.202
    p50:    0.172
    min:    0.005
