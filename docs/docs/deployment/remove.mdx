# Remove Hasura Data from a Database

Hasura saves two schemas in the database that you have designated to store metadata: `hdb_catalog` and `hdb_views`.
These schemas store metadata and track the state of your database.

If you want to remove Hasura from this database, you can use the following commands to drop these schemas using
either a database-management tool or the SQL editor - accessible in the sidebar of any table in the Hasura Console:

```sql
drop schema hdb_views cascade;
drop schema hdb_catalog cascade;
```

:::info Designated metadata database

Note that the database used to store metadata is designated with the
[`HASURA_GRAPHQL_METADATA_DATABASE_URL` environment variable or `--metadata-database-url` startup flag](/deployment/graphql-engine-flags/reference.mdx#metadata-database-url).
If this is not set, the metadata database will be the same as the database used for data.
