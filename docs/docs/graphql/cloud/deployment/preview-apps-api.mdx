# Hasura Cloud Preview Apps API

## TL;DR

With Preview Apps you can automatically create an app on Hasura Cloud for every pull request you make to your GitHub
repo enabling quick and easy testing of changes as you work.

## Introduction

If the `hasura/hasura-cloud-preview-apps` GitHub action does not suit your needs, you can also directly contact the
[createGitHubPreviewApp](/graphql/cloud/api-reference.mdx#api-ref-create-preview-app) API to manually setup Preview
Apps for your GitHub repo.

:::info Note

This feature is currently in beta. Please reach out through our support channels with any questions or concerns.

:::

:::info Usage Limit

For users with only `Free` tier projects on Hasura Cloud, usage of the Preview App API is limited to 60 calls per
month. More plans are coming soon.

:::

A GraphQL mutation to create a Preview App will be of the following format:

```graphql
mutation createGitHubPreviewApp {
  createGitHubPreviewApp(
    payload: {
      githubPersonalAccessToken: "<github_access_token>"
      githubRepoDetails: {
        branch: "main"
        owner: "my-org"
        repo: "my-repo"
        directory: "backend/hasura"
      }
      projectOptions: {
        cloud: "aws"
        region: "us-east-2"
        plan: "cloud_free"
        name: "my-app_name"
        envVars: [
          { key: "HASURA_GRAPHQL_AUTH_HOOK", value: "https://my-webhook.com" }
          { key: "MY_ENV_VAR_1", value: "my value 1" }
        ]
      }
    }
  ) {
    githubPreviewAppJobID # job ID of the Preview App creation job
  }
}
```

This mutation queues the creation of the Preview App and returns a UUID: `githubPreviewAppJobID`. 

You can get the creation status of the Preview App by running the following query at
`https://data.pro.hasura.io/v1/graphql`:

```graphql
query getPreviewAppCreationStatus($jobId: uuid!) {
  jobs_by_pk(id: $jobId) {
    id
    status
    tasks {
      id
      name
      task_events {
        id
        event_type
        public_event_data
        error
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Make sure to set the `githubPreviewAppJobID` in the `id` argument to the GraphQL query.

## How it works

Hasura Cloud exposes the GraphQL mutation
[createGitHubPreviewApp](/graphql/cloud/api-reference.mdx#api-ref-create-preview-app) which can be triggered
programmatically using your Hasura Cloud personal access token. This mutation creates a Hasura Cloud project with the
given set of environment variables and the Migrations and Metadata from a branch of a GitHub repo.

When the mutation is triggered, Hasura Cloud queues the Preview App for creation. If a Preview App with the
same name already exists for a user, it is cleaned up and Migrations and Metadata are applied on a fresh Preview App.
The cleanup is done so that every deployment is declarative and reproducible.
