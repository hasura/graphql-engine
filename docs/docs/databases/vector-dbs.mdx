# How Does Hasura Work With Vector Databases?

## What are vectors?

Vectors are mathematical representations for unstructured data like text, audio, or video data. Vectors generated from
deep neural network models like large language models (LLMs) are of a high-dimension to capture multiple latent
features, which can be then used to classify text, or cluster related text.

Word vectors are numerical representations of individual words that capture their meaning and usage patterns. Each word
is represented as a vector in a high-dimensional space, where the dimensions correspond to different features or
attributes of the word, such as its context, syntactic role, and semantic properties.

## Vectors in the context of Large Language Models

LLMs are trained on public datasets and until a certain point in time. They can’t be used to answer
questions on your new organizational data.

For instance, at the moment, the last training date for OpenAI's `text-davinci-003` model was June 2021 and so it has
no idea about events in 2023.

However, we can steer an LLM to answer queries relevant to our new data by providing the context in which it should
answer the question. This is typically done by providing additional information that it can use. But, given the
limitation on the input size we have to pick the right data to feed to it as context.

We do this by taking all the textual data and chunking it, which is an important strategy for your LLM application.

Now when an input user query comes in, we search for chunks that have similar context and feed to our LLMs.

## Why do we need vector databases?

Vector databases are optimized to search for similar vectors.

Chunking and then searching for relevant chunks can’t be done at query time for large systems with a large amount of
text.

We first chunk and then store all chunked vectors in vector databases so that we can find relevant chunks using semantic
search at the time of query.

## How does Hasura work with a vector databases?

Hasura connects with vector databases just the same way as you would any other relational database. Supported vector
databases will be available for you to integrate in the `Connect Database` section in Console.

To demo these features please [check out our blog post](https://hasura.io/blog/hasura-brings-the-power-of-generative-ai-to-your-data/)
on how to set it up with Weaviate.

### Step 1: Select the driver

In our case the driver is Weaviate:

### Step 2: Connect your database

At this step you have to configure few parameters such as:

- API to access your vector db
- Host of your vector db
- URL scheme: http/https
- The model you would like to use for factorizing text. In this demo example, we only support OpenAI. Hence it
  requests you to provide OpenAI key.

### Step 3: Review your database in the `Data Manager` tab

### Step 4: Create your vector database table (schema)

You will need to define the schema in your vector database. For a walkthrough of setting up a Weaviate schema, refer
to the [tutorial](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/configuration/schema-configuration).

### Step 5:  Track your tables

In order (for schemas) to be accessible for querying using Graph QL you will need to track them.

### Step 6: Define the remote relationship

Define the remote relationship from your vector database to your relational database

           width="1000px" />


### Step 7: Go nuts! Query query query!

You can now query across both your vector database and your existing relational database tables as if they were in
one location.

We have 2 tables in our relational database:

1. Candidate 1

2. Application 2

<Thumbnail src="/img/databases/vector-dbs/application.png" alt="Application 2 table" width="700px" />

Our vector database stores the resume as:

<Thumbnail src="/img/databases/vector-dbs/resume-store.png" alt="Resume store" width="1000px" />

In our GraphQL query we are able to fetch all the candidate and application information for a resume. Hasura brings
them all together to provide this seamless querying experience.
