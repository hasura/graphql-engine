# Quickstart Subscriptions

This quickstart will help you create your first subscription. We're going to subscribe to live updates for a message
thread.

<SampleAppBlock dependent />

## Step 1: Create a Subscription

Head to the `API` tab of the Hasura Console and paste in this value:

```graphql
subscription MessageThreadSubscription($thread_id: uuid = "75e0f7b0-b5fc-11ed-ad85-1a122c2a1c44") {
  messages(where: { thread_id: { _eq: $thread_id } }) {
    created_at
    id
    body
    is_read
  }
}
```

Once hitting run, you should see the following output:

<Thumbnail

  alt="Hasura Scheduled Trigger architecture"
  width="1000"
/>

:::tip That's it?

Yep! Remember, you get subscriptions out of the box with Hasura ðŸ”¥ You won't see any messages in your results yet
because there aren't any in the database, but the subscription is live and running. To test it, and mimic a client
application, let's ping the server with curl in the next step.

:::

## Step 2: Insert a message

To avoid the need for a client application, we'll use curl to insert a message into the database. You can enter the curl
command below into a terminal window, and replace the `<YOUR_ADMIN_SECRET>` and `<YOUR_HASURA_PROJECT_ENDPOINT>` values
with your own:

```shell
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "X-Hasura-Admin-Secret: <YOUR_ADMIN_SECRET>" -d '{"query": "mutation { insert_messages(objects: {body: \"This is a live-updating subscription\", user_id: \"82001336-65b7-11ed-b905-7fa26a16d198\", thread_id: \"75e0f7b0-b5fc-11ed-ad85-1a122c2a1c44\" }) { affected_rows } } "}' <YOUR_HASURA_PROJECT_ENDPOINT>
```

After entering the above command hitting `enter`, you should see the following output on your Console's API tab:

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/subscriptions/subscriptions_quickstart-cloud2.20.0.gif"
  alt="Hasura Scheduled Trigger architecture"
  width="1000"
/>

## Recap

What just happened? Well, you just wrote your first subscription! You can now subscribe to live updates for a message
thread. Think of the possibilities in a real-world application: you can subscribe to live updates for a chat thread, a
shopping cart, or a live leaderboard.

At the start, you created a subscription using the Hasura Console's API tab. This subscription returns the `created_at`,
`id`, `body`, and `is_read` fields for all messages with a `thread_id` equal to the provided value. This allows us to
receive new data, live from the server, rather than just a single response. So, as new messages are inserted into the
database - like we did with the curl command - the subscription will return them.
