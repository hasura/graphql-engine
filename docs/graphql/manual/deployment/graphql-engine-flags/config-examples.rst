The following are a few configuration use cases:

.. _add-admin-secret:

Add an admin secret
-------------------

To add an admin secret to Hasura, pass the ``--admin-secret`` flag with a secret
generated by you.

Run server in this mode using following docker command:

.. code-block:: bash

   docker run -P -d hasura/graphql-engine:latest graphql-engine \
              --database-url postgres://username:password@host:5432/dbname \
                serve \
                --admin-secret XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

Typically, you will also have a webhook for authentication:

.. code-block:: bash

   docker run -P -d hasura/graphql-engine:latest graphql-engine \
              --database-url postgres://username:password@host:5432/dbname \
                serve \
                --admin-secret XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
                --auth-hook https://myauth.mywebsite.com/user/session-info

In addition to flags, the GraphQL engine also accepts environment variables.

In the above case, for adding an admin secret you will use the ``HASURA_GRAPHQL_ADMIN_SECRET``
and for the webhook, you will use the ``HASURA_GRAPHQL_AUTH_HOOK`` environment variables.

.. _cli-with-admin-secret:

Using CLI commands with admin secret
------------------------------------

When you start the GraphQL engine with an admin secret key, CLI commands will also
need this admin secret to contact APIs. It can be set in ``config.yaml`` or as an
environment variable or as a flag to the command. For example, let's look at the
case of the ``console`` command:

In the ``my-project/config.yaml`` file, set a new key ``admin_secret``:

.. code-block:: yaml

   # config.yaml
   endpoint: https://my-graphql-endpoint.com
   admin_secret: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

The console can now contact the GraphQL APIs with the specified admin secret.

.. note::

   If you're setting an ``admin_secret`` in ``config.yaml`` please make sure you do
   not check this file into a public repository.

An alternate and safe way is to pass the admin secret value to the command
as an environment variable:

.. code-block:: bash

   export HASURA_GRAPHQL_ADMIN_SECRET=xxxxx
   hasura console

   # OR in a single line
   HASURA_GRAPHQL_ADMIN_SECRET=xxxxx hasura console

You can also set the admin secret using a flag to the command:

.. code-block:: bash

   hasura console --admin-secret=XXXXXXXXXXXX


.. note::

   The order of precedence for admin secret and endpoint is as follows:

   CLI flag > Environment variable > Config file

.. _configure-cors:

Configure CORS
--------------

By default, all CORS requests to the Hasura GraphQL engine are allowed. To run with more restrictive CORS settings,
use the ``--cors-domain`` flag or the ``HASURA_GRAPHQL_CORS_DOMAIN`` ENV variable. The default value is ``*``,
which means CORS headers are sent for all domains.

The scheme + host with optional wildcard + optional port have to be mentioned.

Examples:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Accepts from https://app.foo.bar.com , https://api.foo.bar.com etc.
   HASURA_GRAPHQL_CORS_DOMAIN="https://*.foo.bar.com"

   # Accepts from https://app.foo.bar.com:8080 , http://api.foo.bar.com:8080,
   # http://app.localhost, http://api.localhost, http://localhost:3000,
   # http://example.com etc.
   HASURA_GRAPHQL_CORS_DOMAIN="https://*.foo.bar.com:8080, http://*.localhost, http://localhost:3000, http://example.com"

   # Accepts from all domain
   HASURA_GRAPHQL_CORS_DOMAIN="*"

   # Accepts only from http://example.com
   HASURA_GRAPHQL_CORS_DOMAIN="http://example.com"


.. note::

  Top-level domains are not considered as part of wildcard domains. You
  have to add them separately. E.g. ``https://*.foo.com`` doesn't include
  ``https://foo.com``.


You can tell Hasura to disable handling CORS entirely via the ``--disable-cors``
flag. Hasura will not respond with CORS headers. You can use this option if
you're already handling CORS on a reverse proxy etc.

.. _console-assets-on-server:

Run console offline *(i.e load console assets from server instead of CDN)*
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Normally the static assets (js, css, fonts, img etc.) required by the console are loaded from a CDN.
Starting with ``v1.0.0-beta.1``, these assets are bundled with the Docker image published by Hasura.
These files can be found at ``/srv/console-assets``.

If you're working in an environment with Hasura running locally and have no
access to internet, you can configure the GraphQL engine to load assets from the
Docker image itself, instead of the CDN.

Set the following env var or flag on the server:

.. code-block:: bash

   # env var
   HASURA_GRAPHQL_CONSOLE_ASSETS_DIR=/srv/console-assets

   # flag
   --console-assets-dir=/srv/console-assets

Once the flag is set, all files in the ``/srv/console-assets`` directory of the
Docker image will be served at the ``/console/assets`` endpoint on the server with
the right content-type headers.

.. note::

   Hasura follows a rolling update pattern for console releases where assets for
   a ``major.minor`` version is updated continuously across all patches. If
   you're using the assets on the server with a Docker image, it might not be the latest
   version of console.

.. _dev-mode:

Dev (debugging) mode
--------------------

The Hasura GraphQL engine may provide additional information for each object in the ``extensions`` key of ``errors``.
The ``internal`` key contains error information including the
generated SQL statement and exception information from Postgres. 
This can be highly useful, especially in the case of debugging errors in :doc:`action <../../actions/debugging>` requests.

By default the ``extensions`` key is not sent in the ``errors`` response. To enable this,
start the GraphQL engine server in debugging mode with the following configuration:

.. code-block:: bash

   # env var
   HASURA_GRAPHQL_DEV_MODE=true

   # flag
   --dev-mode

If you want the debugging mode enabled only for ``admin`` role requests, configure as follows instead of the above:

.. code-block:: bash

   # env var
   HASURA_GRAPHQL_ADMIN_INTERNAL_ERRORS=true

   # flag
   --admin-internal-errors

.. note::

   It is highly recommended to enable debugging only for the ``admin`` role in production.
