# Hasura Pro CLI

## Installing the Hasura Pro CLI

Hasura Pro CLI is distributed as a plugin to the [Hasura Core CLI](/graphql/core/hasura-cli/index.mdx)

- Follow the instructions [here](/graphql/core/hasura-cli/install-hasura-cli.mdx) to install Hasura Core CLI

- Then execute the following command to install the Hasura Pro CLI plugin:

  ```bash
  hasura plugins install pro
  ```

- You can verify the installation by executing the `help` command:

  ```bash
  hasura pro --help
  ```

## Authentication with the Hasura Pro CLI

All interactions from the CLI to Hasuraâ€™s APIs are authenticated using a personal access token generated for your user account.

To set up a token, execute the following command on the CLI:

```bash
hasura pro login
```

This command will show a prompt for entering the personal access token.

Head to your [Hasura Cloud account settings](https://cloud.hasura.io) to create a new token. You can name it something like "cli". Note that the token will be shown only once and as soon as you copy the token, paste it in your terminal prompt.

:::info Keep this token secure!

This token can be used to authenticate against Hasura Pro APIs and your Hasura Cloud projects. Make sure you keep it secure. This is a one-time operation. The token will be valid until you delete it.
