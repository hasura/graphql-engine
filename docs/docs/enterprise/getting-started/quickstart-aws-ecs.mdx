# Quickstart with AWS ECS

<div className='badge badge--primary heading-badge'>Available on: Enterprise Edition</div>

## Introduction

This tutorial will help you set up a cluster, register a task definition, run the Hasura GraphQL Engine as a Linux
Fargate task, and perform other common tasks in Amazon ECS with the AWS CLI.

**This guide requires HGE versions `v2.12.0` and above.** Installation instructions are below.

## Deploying Hasura EE on ECS

### Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes that the following prerequisites have been met:

- The latest version of the AWS CLI is installed and configured. For more information about installing or upgrading your
  AWS CLI, see
  [Installing the AWS Command Line Interface](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html).
- The steps in
  [Set up to use Amazon ECS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/get-set-up-for-amazon-ecs.html)
  have been completed.
- Your AWS user has the required permissions specified in the
  [Amazon ECS first-run wizard permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/security_iam_id-based-policy-examples.html#first-run-permissions).
- You have a Postgres database for storing metadata and Redis for caching / rate limiting, preferably a managed service,
  which is accessible from the ECS containers.
- You have a VPC and security group created to use. This tutorial uses a container image hosted on the Public docker hub
  so your task must have internet access. To give your task a route to the internet, use one of the following options:
  - Use a private subnet with a NAT gateway that has an elastic IP address.
  - Use a public subnet and assign a public IP address to the task.
  - For more information, see
    [Create a virtual private cloud](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/get-set-up-for-amazon-ecs.html#create-a-vpc).

### Step 1: Create a Cluster

If your account already has an ECS cluster you would like to use, skip this step.

Create your own cluster with a unique name with the following command:

```bash
aws ecs create-cluster --cluster-name hasura-fargate-cluster
```

### Step 2: Get the ECS task definition

The [install manifests repo](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/tree/master/install-manifests) contains all
installation manifests required to deploy Hasura anywhere. Get the ECS task definition files from there:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hasura/graphql-engine/stable/install-manifests/enterprise/aws-ecs/hasura-fargate-task.json
```

### Step 3: Set the license key, metadata database URL, Redis database URL and the admin secret

Edit `hasura-fargate-task.json` and set the right values:

```json {6,10,14,18,22}
---
{
  "environment": [
    {
      "name": "HASURA_GRAPHQL_EE_LICENSE_KEY",
      "value": ""
    },
    {
      "name": "HASURA_GRAPHQL_METADATA_DATABASE_URL",
      "value": "postgres://<username>:<password>@hostname:<port>/<dbname>"
    },
    {
      "name": "HASURA_GRAPHQL_REDIS_URL",
      "value": "redis://hostname:6379"
    },
    {
      "name": "HASURA_GRAPHQL_RATE_LIMIT_REDIS_URL",
      "value": "redis://hostname:6379"
    },
    {
      "name": "HASURA_GRAPHQL_ADMIN_SECRET",
      "value": "myadminsecretkey"
    }
  ]
}
```

Examples of `HASURA_GRAPHQL_METADATA_DATABASE_URL`:

- `postgres://admin:password@db-name.region.rds.amazonaws.com:5432/my_db`
- `postgres://admin:@db-name.region.rds.amazonaws.com:5432/my_db` _(if there is no password)_

Examples of `HASURA_GRAPHQL_REDIS_URL` and `HASURA_GRAPHQL_RATE_LIMIT_REDIS_URL`:

- `redis://admin:password@db-name.region.cache.amazonaws.com:6379`
- `redis://db-name.region.cache.amazonaws.com:6379` _(if there is no password)_

:::info Note

- If your **password contains special characters** (e.g. #, %, $, @, etc.), you need to URL encode them in the
  `HASURA_GRAPHQL_METADATA_DATABASE_URL` env var (e.g. %40 for @).

- The Hasura GraphQL engine needs access permissions on your Postgres database as described in
  [Postgres permissions](/deployment/postgres-requirements.mdx#postgres-permissions).

- The `HASURA_GRAPHQL_ADMIN_SECRET` should never be passed from the client to the Hasura GraphQL engine as it would give
  the client full admin rights to your Hasura instance. See [Authentication & Authorization](/auth/index.mdx) for
  information on setting up authentication.

- Convert confidential environment variables such as Postgres / Redis URLs, admin / metrics secrets to fetch from
  secrets,
  [see here for more information](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/specifying-sensitive-data.html).

- Configure logging and monitoring for your Hasura graphql engine instance,
  [see here for more information](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-logging-monitoring.html).

### Step 4: Register the Task Definition

```bash
aws ecs register-task-definition --cli-input-json file://hasura-fargate-task.json
```

### Step 5: List Task Definitions

You can list the task definitions for your account at any time with the list-task-definitions command. The output of
this command shows the `family` and `revision` values that you can use together when calling **run-task** or
**start-task** or **create-service** or **update-service**.

```bash
aws ecs list-task-definitions
```

Output:

```json
{
  "taskDefinitionArns": ["arn:aws:ecs:region:aws_account_id:task-definition/hasura:1"]
}
```

### Step 6: Create a Service

After you have registered a task for your account, you can create a service for the registered task in your cluster. For
this example, you create a service with one instance of the `hasura:1` task definition running in your cluster.

The task requires a route to the internet, so there are two ways you can achieve this. One way is to use a private
subnet configured with a NAT gateway with an elastic IP address in a public subnet. Another way is to use a public
subnet and assign a public IP address to your task. We provide both examples below.

Substitute subnets and security groups in the below commands:

Example using a private subnet:

```bash {7}
aws ecs create-service \
--cluster hasura-fargate-cluster \
--service-name hasura-fargate-service \
--task-definition hasura:1 \
--desired-count 1 \
--launch-type "FARGATE" \
--network-configuration "awsvpcConfiguration={subnets=[subnet-abcd1234],securityGroups=[sg-abcd1234]}"
```

Example using a public subnet:

```bash {7}
aws ecs create-service \
--cluster hasura-fargate-cluster \
--service-name hasura-fargate-service \
--task-definition hasura:1 \
--desired-count 1 \
--launch-type "FARGATE" \
--network-configuration "awsvpcConfiguration={subnets=[subnet-abcd1234],securityGroups=[sg-abcd1234],assignPublicIp=ENABLED}"
```

The **create-service** command returns a description of the task definition after it completes its registration.

### Step 7: Describe the Running Service

Describe the service using the service name retrieved earlier to get more information about the task.

```bash
aws ecs describe-services --cluster hasura-fargate-cluster --services hasura-fargate-service
```

If successful, this will return a description of the service failures and services. For example, in the services
section, you will find information on deployments, such as the status of the tasks as running or pending.

You may also find information on the task definition, the network configuration and time-stamped events. In the failures
section, you will find information on failures, if any, associated with the call. For troubleshooting, see
[Service Event Messages](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-event-messages.html).

### Step 8: Open the Hasura console

Copy the task id from the previous step and describe the task in the service so that you can get the Elastic Network
Interface (ENI) for the task.

Describe the task and locate the ENI ID.

```bash
aws ecs describe-tasks --cluster hasura-fargate-cluster --tasks <task-id-here>
```

The attachment information is listed in the output

```json {16}
{
    "tasks": [
        {
            "attachments": [
                {
                    "id": "d9e7735a-16aa-4128-bc7a-b2d5115029e9",
                    "type": "ElasticNetworkInterface",
                    "status": "ATTACHED",
                    "details": [
                        {
                            "name": "subnetId",
                            "value": "subnetabcd1234"
                        },
                        {
                            "name": "networkInterfaceId",
                            "value": "eni-0fa40520aeEXAMPLE"
                        },
                    ]
                }
…
}
```

Copy the ENI from the above describe-tasks output. Describe the ENI to get the public IP address.

```bash
aws ec2 describe-network-interfaces --network-interface-id  eni-0fa40520aeEXAMPLE
```

The public IP address is in the output.

```json {7}
{
    "NetworkInterfaces": [
        {
            "Association": {
                "IpOwnerId": "amazon",
                "PublicDnsName": "ec2-34-229-42-222.compute-1.amazonaws.com",
                "PublicIp": "198.51.100.2"
            },
…
}

```

Enter the public IP address in your web browser and you should see a webpage that displays the Hasura GraphQL engine
console.

## Updating Hasura GraphQL engine {#ecs-update}

This guide will help you update the Hasura GraphQL engine running on ECS. This guide assumes that you already have the
Hasura GraphQL engine running on ECS.

### Step 1: Check the latest release version

The current latest version is:

<code>
  hasura/graphql-engine:
  <LatestRelease />
</code>

All the versions can be found at:
[https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/releases](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/releases).

### Step 2: Update the container image

In the `hasura-fargate-task.json` file, update the image tag to this latest version.

For example, if you had:

```json {3}
"containerDefinitions": [
    {
        "image": "hasura/graphql-engine:v2.0.1",
    ...
    }
```

you should change it to:

<pre>
  <code>
    "image": "hasura/graphql-engine:
    <LatestRelease />
    ",
  </code>
</pre>

### Step 3: Roll out the change

Register the updated task definition and copy the `taskDefinitionArn` revision number:

```bash
aws ecs register-task-definition --cli-input-json file://hasura-fargate-task.json
```

```json {3}
    {
        "taskDefinition": {
            "taskDefinitionArn": "arn:aws:ecs:region:aws_account_id:task-definition/hasura:7",
```

```bash
aws ecs update-service --cluster hasura-fargate-cluster --service hasura-fargate-service --task-definition hasura:7
```

:::info Note

If you are downgrading to an older version of the GraphQL engine, you might need to downgrade your metadata catalogue
version as described in [Downgrading Hasura GraphQL engine](/deployment/downgrading.mdx).
