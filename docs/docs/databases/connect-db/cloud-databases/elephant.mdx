# Connecting Hasura to an ElephantSQL Postgres Database

## Introduction

This guide explains how to connect a new or existing [ElephantSQL Postgres](https://www.elephantsql.com/) database to a
Hasura instance, either on [Hasura Cloud](https://cloud.hasura.io) or via one of our [self-hosted]
(/deployment/deployment-guides/index.mdx) solutions.

:::info Note

If you plan on using Hasura Cloud, which we recommend, follow steps 1 and 2 below. If you're self-hosting a Hasura instance and
already have a project running, skip to [step 3](#create-pg-db-elephant).

:::

## Step 1: Sign up or log in to Hasura Cloud

Navigate to [Hasura Cloud](https://cloud.hasura.io/signup/?pg=docs&plcmt=body&cta=navigate-to-hasura-cloud&tech=default)
and sign up or log in.

## Step 2: Create a Hasura Cloud project {#create-hasura-project-do}

On the Hasura Cloud dashboard, create a new project:

<Thumbnail src="/img/cloud-dbs/create-hasura-cloud-project.png" alt="Create Hasura Cloud project" />

After the project is initialized successfully, click on `Launch Console` to open the Hasura Console in your browser.

On the Hasura Console, navigate to the `Data` tab and choose `Connect Existing Database`. Hasura will prompt you for a
Postgres Database URL. We'll create this in the next step and then come back here.

## Step 3: Create a Postgres DB on ElephantSQL {#create-pg-db-elephant}

Log into [ElephantSQL](https://customer.elephantsql.com/login).

If this is your first time logging into ElephantSQL, you'll need to create a team. Complete the form and click
`Create team`.

<Thumbnail src="/img/cloud-dbs/elephant/elephant-create-team.png" alt="Create Elephant team" width="700px" />

From here, you'll need to create a new instance:

<Thumbnail

  alt="Create new Elephant instance"
  width="700px"
/>

Choose a name, plan, and - if necessary - tags for this instance. Click `Select Region` when complete:

<Thumbnail

  alt="Add details to Elephant instance"
  width="700px"
/>

Choose a region and click `Review`:

  alt="Choose region for Elephant instance"
  width="700px"
/>

Confirm your selections and click `Create instance`:

Congratulations! You've now created an ElephantSQL Postgres instance you can use with Hasura GraphQL Engine. Follow the
steps below to connect it to Hasura.

## Step 4: Get the database connection URL {#get-db-url}

From your dashboard, click on the name of your instance:

<Thumbnail src="/img/cloud-dbs/elephant/elephant-choose-instance.png" alt="Choose Elephant instance" width="700px" />

The structure of the database connection URL looks as follows:

```bash
postgres://<user-name>:<password>@<host-server>
```

From the `Details` view, copy the URL string to your clipboard:

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/cloud-dbs/elephant/elephant-connection-string.png"
  alt="Get the connection string for the database"
  width="700px"
/>

## Step 5: Finish connecting the database

Back on the Hasura Console, enter the database URL that we retrieved in the previous step:

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/cloud-dbs/elephant/elephant-connect-db.png"
  alt="Add the connection string to your Hasura Console"
  width="700px"
/>

Then click `Connect Database`.

:::info Note

For security reasons, it is recommended to set database URLs as
[env vars](/projects/env-vars.mdx#manage-project-env-vars) and using the env vars to connect to the databases in place
of the raw database URLs.

:::

Voilà. You are ready to start developing.

## Next steps

- You can check out our [30-Minute Hasura Basics Course](https://hasura.io/learn/graphql/hasura/introduction/) and other
  [GraphQL & Hasura Courses](https://hasura.io/learn/) for a more detailed introduction to Hasura.

- If using Hasura Cloud, you can also click the gear icon to manage your Hasura Cloud project. (e.g. add
  [collaborators](/projects/collaborators.mdx#manage-project-collaborators),
  [env vars](/projects/env-vars.mdx#manage-project-env-vars) or
  [custom domains](/projects/domains.mdx#manage-project-domains)).
