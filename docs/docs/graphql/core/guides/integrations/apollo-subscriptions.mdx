# Setting up GraphQL subscriptions using apollo-client

## Setup

This guide assumes you have the basic apollo-client working as per
[https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/get-started/](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/get-started/) and now you want
to enable subscriptions.

### Install packages

```bash
npm install --save apollo-client apollo-link-ws apollo-link-http apollo-link apollo-utilities apollo-cache-inmemory subscriptions-transport-ws
```

Once these packages are installed, import them as follows in the file
where you have currently initialised your client (usually your `App.js`
file).

```javascript
// Remove the apollo-boost import and change to this:
import ApolloClient from "apollo-client";
// Setup the network "links"
import { WebSocketLink } from 'apollo-link-ws';
import { HttpLink } from 'apollo-link-http';
import { split } from 'apollo-link';
import { getMainDefinition } from 'apollo-utilities';
import { InMemoryCache } from 'apollo-cache-inmemory';
```

Below these imports initialise your client to fetch subscriptions along
with query and mutation.

```javascript
const httpLink = new HttpLink({
  uri: "http://<your-app>/v1/graphql", // use https for secure endpoint
});

// Create a WebSocket link:
const wsLink = new WebSocketLink({
  uri: "ws://<your-app>/v1/graphql", // use wss for a secure endpoint
  options: {
    reconnect: true
  }
});

// using the ability to split links, you can send data to each link
// depending on what kind of operation is being sent
const link = split(
  // split based on operation type
  ({ query }) => {
    const { kind, operation } = getMainDefinition(query);
    return kind === 'OperationDefinition' && operation === 'subscription';
  },
  wsLink,
  httpLink,
);

// Instantiate client
const client = new ApolloClient({
  link,
  cache: new InMemoryCache()
})
```

## Write your subscription

Most likely, when switching from `<Query>` to `<subscription>` there are
few things that you might miss out on.

Below is an example where you can convert a query to subscription and
see what changes need to be made when doing so.

```javascript
<Query
  query = {
    gql`
      query fetchTodos($user_id: Int!) {
          todos (
            where: { user_id: {_eq: $user_id }, is_completed: { _eq: false }},
            order_by: id_desc
          ) {
            id
            data
            is_completed
            created_at
            updated_at
          }
       }
    `
  }
>

//when written as subscription

<subscription
  subscription = {
    gql`
      subscription fetchTodos($user_id: Int!) {
          todos (
            where: { user_id: {_eq: $user_id }, is_completed: { _eq: false }},
            order_by: id_desc
          ) {
            id
            data
            is_completed
            created_at
            updated_at
          }
       }
    `
  }
>
```

We can see that there are in total 3 places where the word `query` is
changed to `subscription` and has to be taken care of when switching to
subscriptions.

```none
<Query                                    <subscription
  query = {gql`          ->                 subscription = {gql`
      query {                                 subscription {
        ...                                     ...
```

:::info Caveat

If all the 3 changes are not made, **it works like a query instead of a
subscription** since the code that sets up apollo-link doesn't work.

```javascript
const link = split(
  // split based on operation type
  ({ query }) => {
    const { kind, operation } = getMainDefinition(query);
    console.log({ query: query, kind: kind, operation: operation });
    return kind === 'OperationDefinition' && operation === 'subscription';
  },
  wsLink,
  httpLink,
)
```
