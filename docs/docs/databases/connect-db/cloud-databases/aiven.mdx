# Connecting Hasura to an Aiven Postgres Database

## Introduction

This guide explains how to connect a new or existing [Aiven Postgres](https://aiven.io/postgresql) database to a Hasura
instance, either on [Hasura Cloud](https://cloud.hasura.io) or via one of our
[self-hosted](/deployment/deployment-guides/index.mdx) solutions. If you're exploring Aiven and are interested in
migrating an existing Postgres database - such as from Heroku - check out their
[docs](https://docs.aiven.io/docs/products/postgresql/howto/migrate-pg-dump-restore.html) before continuing below.

:::info Note

If you plan on using Hasura Cloud, which we recommend, follow steps 1 and 2 below. If you're self-hosting a Hasura
instance and already have a project running, skip to [step 3](#create-pg-db-aiven).

:::

## Step 1: Sign up or log in to Hasura Cloud

Navigate to [Hasura Cloud](https://cloud.hasura.io/signup/?pg=docs&plcmt=body&cta=navigate-to-hasura-cloud&tech=default)
and sign up or log in.

## Step 2: Create a Hasura Cloud project {#create-hasura-project-aiven}

On the Hasura Cloud dashboard, create a new project:

<Thumbnail src='/img/cloud-dbs/create-hasura-cloud-project.png' alt='Create Hasura Cloud project' width='1000px' />

After the project is initialized successfully, click on `Launch Console` to open the Hasura Console in your browser.

On the Hasura Console, navigate to the `Data` tab and choose `Connect Existing Database`. Hasura will prompt you for a
Postgres Database URL. We'll create this in the next step and then come back here.

## Step 3: Create a Postgres DB on Aiven {#create-pg-db-aiven}

:::info Note

If you have an existing Aiven Postgres database, you can skip this step and move on to [step 4](#connect-hasura-aiven).

:::

Log into the [Aiven console](https://console.aiven.io/login).

On the Aiven console, click `+ Create a new service`:

<Thumbnail src='/img/cloud-dbs/aiven/create-new-service.png' alt='Create a new service on Aiven' width='1000px' />

Select `Postgres`:

<Thumbnail src='/img/cloud-dbs/aiven/select-postgres.png' alt='Select Postgres on Aiven' width='1000px' />

Scroll down and select the `Cloud Provider`, `Region` and `Service Plan` based on your requirements.

In the end, enter a `Name` for the service:

<Thumbnail src='/img/cloud-dbs/aiven/create-service.png' alt='Create a service on Aiven' width='1000px' />

Then click `Create service`.

:::info Note

If you're using a database user other than the default one, make sure to give it the right
[Postgres permissions](/deployment/postgres-requirements.mdx#managed-pg-permissions).

:::

## Step 4: Allow connections to your DB from Hasura {#connect-hasura-aiven}

On the `Services` dashboard, click on your DB:

<Thumbnail src='/img/cloud-dbs/aiven/select-db.png' alt='Select DB on Aiven' width='1000px' />

Scroll down to `Allowed IP Addresses` and click on `Change`:

<Thumbnail
  src='/img/cloud-dbs/aiven/change-allowed-ip-addresses.png'
  alt='Change allowed IP addresses on Aiven'
  width='1000px'
/>

If you're using Hasura Cloud, you can quickly find your IP address from the `Hasura Cloud IP` field on the project's
details view:

<Thumbnail src='/img/projects/hasura-cloud-ip.png' alt='Hasura Cloud IP field' width='1000px' />

:::info Note

If you're using a self-hosted solution, you'll need to determine the IP address manually depending on your hosting
service.

:::

Add the Hasura IP address that you copied, click on the `+`:

<Thumbnail src='/img/cloud-dbs/aiven/add-hasura-ip.png' alt='Add the Hasura IP on Aiven' width='1000px' />

Then click on `Save changes`.

## Step 5: Get the database connection URL {#get-db-url-aiven}

The structure of the database connection URL looks as follows:

```bash
postgresql://<user-name>:<password>@<public-ip>:<postgres-port>/<db>?sslmode=require
```

To get it, navigate to the `Overview` tab of your database dashboard and copy the `Service URI`:

<Thumbnail src='/img/cloud-dbs/aiven/copy-service-uri.png' alt='Copy the service URI on Aiven' width='1000px' />

## Step 6: Finish connecting the database

Back on the Hasura Console, enter the database URL that we retrieved in [step 5](#get-db-url-aiven):

<Thumbnail src='/img/cloud-dbs/aiven/Aiven-complete.png' alt='Database setup' width='600px' />

Then click `Connect Database`.

:::info Note

For security reasons, it is recommended to set database URLs as [env vars](/projects/env-vars.mdx) and using the env
vars to connect to the databases in place of the raw database URLs.

:::

Voilà. You are ready to start developing.

## Next steps

- You can check out our [30-Minute Hasura Basics Course](https://hasura.io/learn/graphql/hasura/introduction/) and other
  [GraphQL & Hasura Courses](https://hasura.io/learn/) for a more detailed introduction to Hasura.

- If using Hasura Cloud, you can also click the gear icon to manage your Hasura Cloud project. (e.g. add
  [collaborators](/projects/collaborators.mdx), [env vars](/projects/env-vars.mdx) or
  [custom domains](/projects/domains.mdx)).
