# Authentication & Authorization

In Hasura, access control or authorization is based on **roles**. Let's
take a look at how this works when the GraphQL engine receives a
request:

  alt="Authentication and authorization with Hasura"
/>

As you can see from this:

-   **Authentication** is handled outside of Hasura. Hasura delegates
    authentication and resolution of request headers into session
    variables to your authentication service *(existing or new)*.

    Your authentication service is required to pass a user's **role**
    information in the form of session variables like `X-Hasura-Role`,
    etc. More often than not, you'll also need to pass user information
    for your access control use cases, like `X-Hasura-User-Id`, to build
    permission rules.

-   For **Authorization** or **Access Control**, Hasura helps you define
    granular role-based access control rules for every field in your
    GraphQL schema *(granular enough to control access to any row or
    column in your database)*.

    Hasura uses the role/user information in the session variables and
    the actual request itself to validate the request against the rules
    defined by you. If the request/operation is allowed, it generates an
    SQL query, which includes the row/column-level constraints from the
    access control rules, and sends it to the database to perform the
    required operation (_fetch the required rows for queries,
    insert/edit rows for mutations, etc._).

  .. admonition:: Adding collaborators in Hasura Cloud
    :class: dhc

    Hasura Cloud offers collaborators in addition to role management. Collaborators can be granted access to specific portions of the console, like Metrics. Additionally, adding collaborators allows you to avoid sharing the `HASURA-ADMIN-SECRET`. For more information about collaborator management, see :ref:`Collaborators in Hasura Cloud <manage_project_collaborators>`.
