The easiest way to bring live data to your UI is using the Subscription from `apolloClient.subscribe`. This lets you render the stream of data from your service directly within your UI! One thing to note, subscriptions are just listeners, they donâ€™t request any data when first connected, but only open up a connection to get new data.
