Introduction
------------

You can transfer ownership of your project to another user. After the ownership is transferred successfully, the original 
owner will lose all access to the project.

.. note::

   If the project is on the Standard (pay-as-you-go) tier, the new owner will pay for the entire data usage for the month in which the ownership is transferred.

Send an ownership transfer invitation
-------------------------------------

Go to the project settings page and scroll to the bottom. Enter the email of the user you want to transfer the project ownership to.
