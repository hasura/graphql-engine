# Connecting Hasura to a GCP Postgres Database

## Introduction

This guide explains how to connect a new or existing [GCP Postgres database](https://cloud.google.com/sql) to a Hasura
instance, either on [Hasura Cloud](https://cloud.hasura.io) or via one of our
[self-hosted](/deployment/deployment-guides/index.mdx) solutions. If you're exploring GCP Postgres and are
interested in migrating an existing Postgres database - such as from Heroku - check out their
[docs](https://cloud.google.com/database-migration/docs/postgres) before continuing below.

:::info Note

If you plan on using Hasura Cloud, which we recommend, follow steps 1 and 2 below. If you're self-hosting a Hasura instance and
already have a project running, skip to [step 3](#create-pg-db-gcp).

:::

## Step 1: Sign up or log in to Hasura Cloud

Navigate to [Hasura Cloud](https://cloud.hasura.io/signup/?pg=docs&plcmt=body&cta=navigate-to-hasura-cloud&tech=default)
and sign up or log in.

## Step 2: Create a Hasura Cloud project {#create-hasura-project-gcp}

On the Hasura Cloud dashboard, create a new project:

<Thumbnail src="/img/cloud-dbs/create-hasura-cloud-project.png" alt="Create Hasura Cloud project" width="1000px" />

After the project is initialized successfully, click on `Launch Console` to open the Hasura Console in your browser.

On the Hasura Console, navigate to the `Data` tab and choose `Connect Existing Database`. Hasura will prompt you for a
Postgres Database URL. We'll create this in the next step and then come back here.

## Step 3: Create a Postgres DB on GCP {#create-pg-db-gcp}

:::info Note

If you have an existing Postgres database on GCP, you can skip this step and move on to
[step 4](#allow-connections).

:::

Log into the [GCP console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).

On the left-side navigation, scroll down to `Storage` and click on `SQL`:

<Thumbnail src="/img/cloud-dbs/gcp/navigate-to-sql.png" alt="Navigate to SQL in GCP" width="250px" />

On the top, click on `Create instance`:

<Thumbnail src="/img/cloud-dbs/gcp/create-instance.png" alt="Create database instance in GCP" width="1000px" />

Select Postgres:

<Thumbnail src="/img/cloud-dbs/gcp/select-postgres.png" alt="Select Postgres database instance in GCP" width="1000px" />

Select an instance ID, as well as a default user password. If required, choose a specific region and zone.

<Thumbnail src="/img/cloud-dbs/gcp/configure-instance.png" alt="Configure database instance in GCP" width="500px" />

Then click `Create`.

## Step 4: Allow connections to your DB from Hasura {#allow-connections}

On the dashboard of your GCP database instance, on the left sidebar, click on `Connections`. Then scroll down to the
checkbox `Public IP`, and click `+ Add network`:

<Thumbnail src="/img/cloud-dbs/gcp/connections.png" alt="Navigate to connections in GCP" width="600px" />

You can choose an optional name (e.g. "Hasura").

If using Hasura Cloud, from your project's dashboard, copy the Hasura Cloud IP address:

<Thumbnail src="/img/projects/hasura-cloud-ip.png" alt="Hasura Cloud IP field" width="1000px" />

:::info Note

If you're using a self-hosted solution, you'll need to determine the IP address manually depending on your hosting
service.

:::

Enter the Hasura IP address that you copied:

<Thumbnail src="/img/cloud-dbs/gcp/add-network.png" alt="Add a new network in GCP" width="600px" />

Then click `Save`.

:::info Note

If you're using a database user other than the default one, make sure to give it the right
[Postgres permissions](/deployment/postgres-requirements.mdx#managed-pg-permissions).

:::

## Step 5: Construct the database connection URL {#construct-db-url-gcp}

The structure of the database connection URL looks as follows:

```bash
postgresql://<user-name>:<password>@<public-ip>:<postgres-port>/
```

- `user-name`: If you have a separate database user, the user name will be their name. If you didn't specify a user, the
  default user name is `postgres`.
- `password`: If you have a separate database user, use their password. Otherwise, use the password that you chose when
  creating the database.
- `public-ip`: The public IP can be optained by clicking on `Overview` on the left-side navigation and then scrolling
  down to `Connect to this instance`:

<Thumbnail src="/img/cloud-dbs/gcp/public-ip.png" alt="Find the public IP for a GCP Postgres database" width="700px" />

- `postgres-port`: The default port for Postgres is `5432` if not specified otherwise.
- `db`: The DB is `postgres` by default unless otherwise specified.

## Step 6: Finish connecting the database

Back on the Hasura Console, enter the database URL that we retrieved in [step 5](#construct-db-url-gcp):

<Thumbnail src="/img/cloud-dbs/gcp/GCP-complete.png" alt="Database setup" width="600px" />

Then click `Connect Database`.

:::info Note

For security reasons, it is recommended to set database URLs as [env vars](/projects/env-vars.mdx) and using the env
vars to connect to the databases in place of the raw database URLs.

:::

Voilà. You are ready to start developing.

## Step 7 (optional): Enable SSL connection

### Step 7.1 Get GCP SSL Certs

Google Cloud (GCP) SQL makes the following SSL/TLS certificates available for download:

- A server certificate saved as `server-ca.pem`
- A client public key certificate saved as `client-cert.pem`
- A client private key saved as `client-key.pem`

:::info Note Please refer to the
[Google Cloud Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/configure-ssl-instance?&_ga=2.87107544.-1769733723.1651179247#server-certs)
for detailed information about the different certs.

:::

Download these certs to your local drive.

### Step 7.2: Add env vars

If using Hasura Cloud, go to your project and add the following env vars:

(Open the cert files using your favorite text editor, select all the contents and copy them to the clipboard)

| Env Var Name       | Value                           |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| `SSL_ROOTCERT_GCP` | Contents from `server-ca.pem`   |
| `SSL_CERT_GCP`     | Contents from `client-cert.pem` |
| `SSL_KEY_GCP`      | Contents from `client-key.pem`  |

Here is how your Hasura Cloud env vars setup should look like:

<Thumbnail src="/img/cloud-dbs/gcp/cloud-gcp-env-vars.png" alt="Hasura Cloud Env Vars" width="1000px" />

:::info Note

If you're using a self-hosted solution, you can set these env vars in your `docker-compose.yml` file.

:::

### Step 7.3: Configure SSL settings

Open the Console of your Hasura project, go to the `Data -> Manage -> [db-name] -> Edit` page.

Under `Connection Settings` add the following SSL certificate settings:

| Field Name             | Value                              |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `SSL Mode`             | `verify-ca` (select from dropdown) |
| `SSL Root Certificate` | `SSL_ROOTCERT_GCP`                 |
| `SSL Certificate`      | `SSL_CERT_GCP`                     |
| `SSL Key`              | `SSL_KEY_GCP`                      |

Here is how the setup should look like:

<Thumbnail src="/img/cloud-dbs/gcp/ssl-config-setup.png" alt="Hasura Console SSL Config Setup" width="1000px" />

Finally, click on the `Update Connection` button to apply the SSL settings.

  [GraphQL & Hasura Courses](https://hasura.io/learn/) for a more detailed introduction to Hasura.

- If using Hasura Cloud, you can also click the gear icon to manage your Hasura Cloud project. (e.g. add
  [collaborators](/projects/collaborators.mdx), [env vars](/projects/env-vars.mdx) or
  [custom domains](/projects/domains.mdx)).
