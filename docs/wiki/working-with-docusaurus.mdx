# Working with Docusaurus

If you're interested in a deep dive on Docusaurus and how it works, check out [their docs](https://docusaurus.io/docs).
This page is intended to serve as a crash course on common conventions within Docusaurus and how they apply to Hasura's
docs ðŸ¤™

:::info Guides

Also checkout their [Guides](https://docusaurus.io/docs/category/guides), they are pretty detailed.

Please check the [client API docs](https://docusaurus.io/docs/docusaurus-core) for available React components, hooks &

## Sidebar

### Label & position

**For Individual Files**

Use of `sidebar_label` and `sidebar_position` frontmatter

```markdown title=graphql/core/actions/create.mdx
---
sidebar_label: Creating actions
sidebar_position: 1
---
```

**For Directories (Categories)**

By default, index.mdx doc's - `sidebar_label` & `sidebar_position` will be applied for directories.

To override, please add a `_category_.json` and add the `label` and `position` properties.

```json title=graphql/core/actions/_category_.json
{
  "label": "Actions",
  "position": 3
}
```

### index.mdx file only directories

This is known and default behavior from docusaurus. `index` is considered direct link to directory index and won't be
visible unless there is one more file.

If you only have an index.mdx file, prefer `directory.mdx` over `directory/index.mdx`.

## URL slug

This only applies for index.mdx files.

index file routes are resolved to `directory/` and not `directory/index`

Use `slug` metadata to manually set the slug to `index`. Please check
[this PR on docusaurus](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/5830) for more information.

```markdown title="graphql/core/actions/index.mdx"
---
slug: index
---
```

## Styling

The majority of styles is controlled through CSS variables - there is a heavy list available (use the browser inspect
element to see the complete list).

These variables can be overridden and new custom styles to be added in `src/css/custom.scss` and
`src/css/_custom-dark.scss` for light and dark themes respectively.

## React components

Add any new React Components to the `src/components/ComponentName` directory. Add the `index.tsx` file and use
`styles.module.scss` for styling to not let this collide with global styles.

Then this component can be imported with `@site` global directive.

`import ComponentName from '@site/src/components/ComponentName';`

:::tip

Check existing components for a better idea.

## Static assets

All the static assets lives in `static` directory.

| Asset  | Directory      |
| ------ | -------------- |
| Images | `static/img`   |
| Fonts  | `static/fonts` |
| Icons  | `static/icons` |

## Updating to latest Docusaurus version

Checkout the change log for latest releases and changes involved - https://docusaurus.io/changelog/

Please ensure to check breaking changes and re-swizzle any swizzled components given they are part of breaking changes.

Any [swizzled](https://docusaurus.io/docs/swizzling) component will be cloned to `src/theme`.

**An Example:** The `TOCInline` and `TOCItems` components are [swizzled](https://docusaurus.io/docs/swizzling) and
custom logic is added.

The custom added logic (`src/theme/TOCInline`, `src/theme/TOCItems`) is indicated by comments - `// Customization START`
and `// Customization END`. If reswizzled in the future, only these blocks need an update.

[`toc` is a flat array](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/inline-toc#custom-table-of-contents) and has no
concept of nested tree children structure. This behavior is changed in `2.0.0-beta.16`. Please check the
[Breaking changes that forced us to swizzle](https://docusaurus.io/changelog/2.0.0-beta.16#-breaking-change).
