# Installing / Uninstalling the Hasura CLI

## Installing the Hasura CLI

### Installing through npm

The Hasura CLI is conveniently available as an npm package which wraps the compiled binary and is independently
maintained by members of the community. It can be beneficial to use the npm package if you want a  version-fixed CLI
dedicated to your node.js project. You can find usage details (e.g. flag information) in the
[original repository](https://github.com/jjangga0214/hasura-cli). To install the CLI, you can use npm (or yarn):

```bash
# install as a devDependency of your project
npm install --save-dev hasura-cli[@tag|@version]

# or install globally on your system
npm install --global hasura-cli[@tag|@version]
```

### Installing the Hasura CLI binary globally

If you prefer to install the binary globally, you can download it by following the instructions for your
operating system:

<Tabs className="api-tabs">
<TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">

In your Linux shell, run the following command:

```bash
curl -L https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/raw/stable/cli/get.sh | bash
```

This will install the Hasura CLI in `/usr/local/bin`. You might have to provide your `sudo` password depending on the
permissions of your `/usr/local/bin` location.

If you'd prefer to install to a different location other than `/usr/local/bin`, set the `INSTALL_PATH` variable
accordingly:

```bash
curl -L https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/raw/stable/cli/get.sh | INSTALL_PATH=$HOME/bin bash
```

You can also install a specific version of the CLI by providing the `VERSION` variable:

```bash
curl -L https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/raw/stable/cli/get.sh | VERSION=v2.2.0 bash
```

In your Terminal, run the following command:

```bash

```

This will install the Hasura CLI in `/usr/local/bin`. You might have to provide your `sudo` password depending on the
permissions of your `/usr/local/bin` location.

If you'd prefer to install to a different location other than `/usr/local/bin`, set the `INSTALL_PATH` variable
accordingly:

```bash
curl -L https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/raw/stable/cli/get.sh | INSTALL_PATH=$HOME/bin bash
```

You can also install a specific version of the CLI by providing the `VERSION` variable:

```bash
curl -L https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/raw/stable/cli/get.sh | VERSION=v2.2.0 bash
```

<TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">

Download the binary `cli-hasura-windows-amd64.exe` available under `Assets` of the latest release from the GitHub
release page :

<Link to='https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/releases'>https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/releases</Link>

Rename the downloaded file to `hasura`. You can add the path to the environment variable `PATH` for making `hasura`
accessible globally.

## Uninstalling the Hasura CLI

### Uninstalling through npm

If you installed the CLI as an npm package, use npm (or yarn):

```bash
# if installed as a project dependency
npm uninstall hasura-cli

# if installed as a global package
npm uninstall --global hasura-cli
```

### Uninstalling a binary globally

If you installed the binary directly on your system, delete the binary file from its installation location.

```bash
# By default, the binary is installed at /usr/local/bin/hasura
$ which hasura
  /usr/local/bin/hasura

# use sudo if required
$ rm /usr/local/bin/hasura
```
