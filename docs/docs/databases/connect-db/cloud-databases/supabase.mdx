# Using Hasura Cloud with a Supabase Postgres Database

<div className='badge badge--primary heading-badge'>Available on: Cloud</div>

## Introduction

This guide explains how to connect a new or existing Supabase Postgres database to a Hasura Cloud project. If you're
exploring Supabase Postgres and are interested in migrating an existing Postgres database - such as from Heroku - check
out their [docs](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/migrations/heroku) before continuing below.

## Step 1: Sign up or log in to Hasura Cloud

Navigate to [Hasura Cloud](https://cloud.hasura.io/signup/?pg=docs&plcmt=body&cta=navigate-to-hasura-cloud&tech=default)
and sign up or log in.

## Step 2: Create a Hasura Cloud project {#create-hasura-project}

On the Hasura Cloud dashboard, create a new project:

<Thumbnail src='/img/cloud-dbs/create-hasura-cloud-project.png' alt='Create Hasura Cloud project' />

After the project is initialized successfully, click on `Launch Console` to open the Hasura Console in your browser.

On the Hasura Console, navigate to `Data -> Manage -> Connect Database -> Connect existing database`:

You will get prompted for a Postgres Database URL. We will create this in the next step and then come back here.

## Step 3: Create a Postgres DB on Supabase ([skip if you have an existing DB](#get-db-url))

Log into [Supabase](https://app.supabase.com/) using your GitHub login.

From your dashboard, click `New project`:

  alt='Create a new project with Supabase'
  width='700px'
/>

If you don't already have an organization within Supabase, you'll need to create a one. Click `New organization`:

<Thumbnail
  src='/img/cloud-dbs/supabase/supabase-create-new-organization.png'
  alt='Create a new organization with Supabase'
  width='700px'
/>

Fill in a name and click `Create organization`:

<Thumbnail
  src='/img/cloud-dbs/supabase/supabase-new-organization-name.png'
  alt='Name your organization with Supabase'
  width='700px'
/>

After creating your organization, you'll be presented with the `Create a new project` view. Fill in the necessary
information and click `Create new project`:

<Thumbnail
  src='/img/cloud-dbs/supabase/supabase-create-new-project-confirm.png'
  alt='Confirm project creation'
  width='700px'
/>

You'll be redirected to your project's dashboard. After a few minutes, your database should be provisioned. You'll know
you're ready once your dashboard changes from this:

<Thumbnail

  alt='Dashboard as project is being provisioned'
  width='700px'
/>

To this:

<Thumbnail

  alt='Dashboard view after provisioning is complete'
  width='700px'
/>

Congratulations! You've now created a Postgres instance on Supabase which you can use with Hasura GraphQL Engine. Follow
the steps below to connect it to Hasura.

## Step 4: Get the database connection URL {#get-db-url}

The structure of the database connection URL looks as follows:

```bash
postgresql://<user-name>:<password>@<host-server>:<port>/<database-name>
```

From your database's dashboard, click the `Settings` icon on the side navigation:

<Thumbnail
  src='/img/cloud-dbs/supabase/supabase-dashboard-settings.png'
  alt='From dashboard, choose settings on the left-hand side'
  width='700px'
/>

Choose `Database`:

<Thumbnail
  src='/img/cloud-dbs/supabase/supabase-database-view.png'
  alt='Database information within the settings view'
  width='700px'
/>

Then scroll down to find the `Connection string` section. Select the `URI` option and copy the string:

:::info Note

You'll need to replace `[YOUR-PASSWORD]` with your project's password.

:::

## Step 5: Finish connecting the database

Back on the Hasura Console, enter the database URI that we retrieved in the previous step:

<Thumbnail
  src='/img/cloud-dbs/supabase/supabase-connected-db.png'
  alt='Connect the database on Hasura Console'
  width='700px'
/>

Then click `Connect Database`.

:::info Note

For security reasons, it is recommended to set database URLs as
[env vars](/projects/env-vars.mdx#manage-project-env-vars) and using the env vars to connect to the databases in place
of the raw database URLs.

Voil√†. You are ready to start developing.

## Next steps

You can check out our [30-Minute Hasura Basics Course](https://hasura.io/learn/graphql/hasura/introduction/) and other
[GraphQL & Hasura Courses](https://hasura.io/learn/) for a more detailed introduction to Hasura.

You can also click the gear icon to manage your Hasura Cloud project. (e.g. add
[collaborators](/projects/collaborators.mdx#manage-project-collaborators),
[env vars](/projects/env-vars.mdx#manage-project-env-vars) or
[custom domains](/projects/domains.mdx#manage-project-domains)).
