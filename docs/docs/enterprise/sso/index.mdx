# Enable Single Sign-on

<div className="badge badge--primary heading-badge">Available on: Self-hosted Enterprise</div>

## Introduction

With Hasura Enterprise Edition, you can enable SSO (Single Sign-On) on the Hasura Console with your identity management
system through the [OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net) / [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/connect) protocol.

Hasura provides full support for OAuth 2.0 as a Single Sign-On (SSO) solution without the need for additional tooling or
services. OAuth 2.0 is an industry-standard protocol that enables secure and delegated access to protected resources.

Hasura SSO can also be extended to use additional providers by leveraging [Dex](https://github.com/dexidp/dex).

:::info Supported from

SSO is supported from versions `v2.24.0-beta.1` and above.

We only support the [Proof Key for Code Exchange](https://oauth.net/2/pkce/) extension to prevent CSRF and authorization
code injection attacks.
