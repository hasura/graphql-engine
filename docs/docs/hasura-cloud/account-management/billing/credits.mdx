# Coupons and Credits

<ProductBadge standard pro ee />

## Introduction

If you have a coupon, you can redeem it from the dashboard to get a credit waiver on your next invoice. Discounts will
be adjusted while creating the invoice.

## Redeem a coupon

Navigate to the `Billing` tab, click on `Coupons and Credits`, enter the code and click on the redeem button. Only one
coupon is applied.

:::info

Note If there is an active coupon and another coupon is applied, then the later coupon is used.
