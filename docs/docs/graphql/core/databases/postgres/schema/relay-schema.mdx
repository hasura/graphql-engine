# Postgres: Relay schema

## Introduction

The Hasura GraphQL engine serves a [Relay](https://relay.dev/) schema
for Postgres tables which have a primary key defined. The Relay schema
can be accessed through the `/v1beta1/relay` endpoint.

:::tip Supported from

Relay is supported from versions `v1.3.0` and above.

## What is Relay?

Relay is an opinionated JavaScript framework for declaratively fetching
and managing GraphQL data. Relay's strength lies in how it removes
opportunities for developer errors, by providing conventions that result
in performant and type-safe apps.

While using Relay saves you work on the client side with tasks like
pagination, using Relay and Hasura together saves you even more work,
because Hasura automatically sets up the Relay backend for you on top of
your database.

## Benefits of Relay

Relay's client-side benefits include:

-   **Colocation**: By convention, GraphQL fragments are colocated with
    their views, so that each component describes exactly what data it
    needs. This declarative approach has several benefits:
    -   It's hard to over-fetch data (which would hurt performance), or
        under-fetch data (which might cause errors).
    -   Components can only access data they've asked for. This **data
        masking** prevents implicit data dependency bugs.
    -   Components only re-render when the exact data they're using is
        updated, preventing unnecessary re-renders.
-   **Performance**: The Relay compiler composes your GraphQL fragments
    into optimized and efficient batches to reduce round-trips to the
    server. The compiler also applies
    [transforms](https://relay.dev/docs/principles-and-architecture/compiler-architecture/#transforms)
    to your queries to remove redundancies and shorten query strings,
    which reduces upload bytes.
-   **Strong typing**: The compiler automatically generates Flow (or
    TypeScript) types, which you can import into your component for type
    checking in your code editor and during build time.

To learn more about these and other Relay features, like persisted
queries, local state management, passing arguments to fragments, and
fetching data as early as possible, check out the [Relay docs](https://relay.dev/docs/getting-started/step-by-step-guide/).

## Relay's server spec

To support the above client-side benefits, Relay has a particular server specification.

*Hasura's Relay API sets up this spec for you automatically, so you
don't have to implement it manually.*

According to the spec, the server must provide:

-   **A mechanism for refetching an object**: The convention is a **Node
    interface** with a globally unique `id` field, as well as a root
    field called `node`, which allows fetching data by this `id`. This
    is great for performance on the client side, but hard to implement
    on the server side, since you have to make sure `id`'s are globally
    unique, objects can be re-fetched via their `id`'s, etc.
-   **A description of how to page through connections**: Connections
    are Relay's way of **standardizing pagination**. They allow us to
    communicate more info between the client and the server, such as
    cursors and page info, so that we can paginate in a predictable
    pattern. On the client side, Relay saves you a ton of work by
    keeping track of the moving parts of pagination and merging results
    automatically.

to see how to set up pagination with Hasura and Relay.

## Node interface

The `Node` interface in the Relay schema has exactly one field which
returns a non-null `ID` value. Each table object type in the Relay
schema should implement the `Node` interface to provide [global object identification](https://relay.dev/graphql/objectidentification.htm).

To identify each row in a table, the `id` field value is encoded with
table information (schema and name) and primary key column values. The
GraphQL engine uses `base64` encoded JSON string and the JSON schema
looks as follows:

`[<version-integer>, "<table-schema>", "<table-name>", "column-1", "column-2", ... "column-n"]`

-   `version-integer`: The JSON schema version (the current version is
    `1`). This is to enable any backward compatibility if the JSON
    representation has to change.
-   `table-schema`: The table's schema.
-   `table-name`: The table's name.
-   `column-1`.. `column-n`: The primary key column values. The order is
    Postgres dependent.

The same `base64` encoded JSON string is accepted for the root `node`
field resolver's `id` input.

### Example

For the `author` table in the `public` schema whose primary key column
is `author_id`, of type `uuid`.

```json
[1, "public", "author", "296d30b1-474d-4011-a907-2701992b04c1"]
```

And `base64` encoded value is

```none

```

## Exporting the Relay schema

You can export the Relay schema in the same way as you can
[export the GraphQL schema](/graphql/core/guides/export-graphql-schema.mdx). But instead of the
GraphQL endpoint, you can specify the Relay endpoint, which will end in
`/v1beta1/relay`.

## Limitations

At this time, Hasura's Relay implementation only supports Postgres
tables with a primary key defined, and custom SQL functions whose
returning table has a primary key defined.

Persisted queries will be supported soon.

:::info Note

Currently, Hasura's Relay schema doesn't expose remote schemas or
actions. This will be fixed in future releases.
