Error: the aggregate expression 'Int4_aggregate_exp (in subgraph default)' is used with the model 'Invoice (in subgraph default)' but the count aggregate's return type (Int) does not have a scalar type representation mapping to the 'mypg (in subgraph default)' data connector's count aggregate type 'count_agg_type'
