-- A project configuration for general-purpose development: this builds documentation for
-- dependencies and disables optimizations for graphql-engine to improve compilation times.
--
-- From the project root, this configuration can be linked directly:
--   $ ln -s cabal/dev.project cabal.project.local
--
-- ...or, it can be copied if you would like to customize any settings:
--   $ cp cabal/cabal.project.dev cabal.project.local

package graphql-engine
  -- NOTE: this seems to work so long as there is no 'ghc-options: -O2' in the cabal file,
  -- but new-build will report 'Build profile: -O1' for some reason.
  -- See:https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/6221
