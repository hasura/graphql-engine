# Authorization / Access control

## Overview

Hasura supports **role-based** authorization where access control is
done by creating rules for each role, table and operation (*insert*,
*update*, etc.). These access control rules use dynamic session
variables that are passed to the GraphQL engine from your
[authentication service](/graphql/core/auth/authentication/index.mdx) with every request. Role
information is inferred from the `X-Hasura-Role` and
`X-Hasura-Allowed-Roles` session variables. Other session variables can
be passed by your auth service as per your requirements.

**For example:**

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/graphql/core/auth/hasura-perms.png"
  alt="Create a permission rule"
  width="800px"
/>

:::info Note

Hasura roles and permissions are implemented at the Hasura layer. They
have nothing to do with Postgres roles and users.

## Trying out access control

If you just want to see role-based access control in action, you need
not set up or integrate your auth service with GraphQL engine. You can
just:

-   Define permission rules for a table for a role.
-   Use the GraphiQL interface in the console to make a request and send
    the session variables as request headers (*send a* `X-Hasura-Role`
    *key, with its value as the name of the role you've defined rules
    for*). The data in the response will be restricted as per your
    configuration.

Follow the example at [access control basics](/graphql/core/auth/authorization/basics.mdx).

Additional access controls and API limits like maximum query depth can
be found in Hasura Cloud. See more at
