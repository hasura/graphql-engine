Renaming relationships
======================

To rename a relationship, head to ``Data -> [table-name] -> Relationships`` in the console, drop the existing
relationship and recreate it with the new name.

.. note::

  You might not be allowed to drop a relationship if it has been referenced elsewhere (e.g. in a permissions rule).
