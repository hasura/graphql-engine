## Introduction

This is a guide to help you set up a basic authorization architecture
for your GraphQL fields. It is recommended that you first check out
`roles_variables` and `permission_rules` that will be referred to
throughout this guide.

Here are some examples of common use cases.

## Anonymous (not logged in) users

-   Create a role called `anonymous` (this value is up to you, you could
    even name the role `public`).
-   Generally, you wouldn't add insert, update, or delete permissions.
-   For the select permission condition, create a valid condition
    depending on your data model. For example,
    `is_published: {_eq: true}`.
-   If you don't have a condition, then just set the permission to
    `Without any checks`, represented by a `{}`.
-   Choose the right set of columns that will get exposed in the GraphQL
    schema as fields. Ensure that sensitive information will not be
    exposed.

See `unauthenticated_access` for steps to configure the anonymous user
role in Hasura.

## Logged-in users

-   Create a role called `user`.
-   Access control rules in this case are usually dependent on a
    `user_id` or a `owner_id` column in your data model.
-   Set up a permission for insert/select/update/delete that uses said
    column. E.g.: `author_id: {_eq: "X-Hasura-User-Id"}` for an article
    table.
-   Note that the `X-Hasura-User-Id` is a
    `dynamic session variable<roles_variables>` that comes in from your
    `auth webhook's <auth_webhooks>` response, or as a request header if
    you're testing.

## Managers of an organisation in a multi-tenant app

Suppose you have a multi-tenant application where managers of a
particular organisation can see all of the data that belongs to the
organisation. In this case, your data models will probably have an
`org_id` column that denotes the organisation either in the same table
or via a related table.

-   Create a role called `manager`.
-   Create a permission for select, which has the condition:
    `org_id: {_eq: "X-Hasura-Org-Id"}`.
-   `X-Hasura-Org-Id` is a `dynamic variable <roles_variables>` that is
    returned by your `auth webhook <auth_webhooks>` for an incoming
    GraphQL request.

## Collaborators of an article

Let's say the "ownership" or "visibility" information for a data model
(table) is not present as a column in the table, but in a different
related table. In this case, let's say there is an `article` table and a
`collaborator` table that has `article_id, collaborator_id` columns.

-   Create a relationship called `collaborators` from the article table.
    -   Array relationship (article has array of collaborators):
        `article :: id → collaborator :: article_id`.
-   Create a role called `collaborator`.
-   Create a select permission on the `article` table, which has the
    condition:
    `collaborators: {collaborator_id: {_eq: "X-Hasura-User_id"}}`.
    -   This reads as: Allow the role collaborator to select if
        `article.collaborators` has a `collaborator_id` equal to that of
        `X-Hasura-User-Id`.

## Multiple roles per user

Sometimes your data/user model requires that:

-   Users can have multiple roles.
-   Each role has access to different parts of your database schema.

If you have the information about roles and how they map to your data in
the same database as the one configured with the GraphQL engine, you can
leverage relationships to define permissions that effectively control
access to data and the operations each role is allowed to perform.

To understand how this works, let's model the roles and corresponding
permissions in the context of a blog app with the following roles:

-   `author`: Users with this role can submit **their own** articles.
-   `reviewer`: Users with this role can review **articles assigned to
    them** and add a review comment to each article. A mapping of
    articles to reviewers is maintained in the `reviewers` table.
-   `editor`: Users with this role can edit and publish **any article**.
    They can also leave a private rating for each article. However, they
    cannot overwrite a reviewer's notes. A list of editors is maintained
    in the `editors` table.

### Database Schema

The following is a reference database schema for our example:

<div class="thumbnail"
alt="Database schema example for multiple roles per user">

/img/graphql/core/auth/multirole-example-db-schema.png

</div>

Based on the above schema, we'll create the following tables:

```sql
-- user information from your auth system

users (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT,
  profile JSONB, -- some profile information like display_name, etc.
  registered_at TIMESTAMP -- the time when this user registered 
)

-- information about articles

articles (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  title TEXT,
  author_id INT REFERENCES users(id), -- Foreign key to users :: id
  is_reviewed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  review_comment TEXT,
  is_published BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  editor_rating INTEGER
)

-- mapping of reviewers to articles

reviewers (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  article_id INTEGER REFERENCES articles(id), -- Foreign key to articles :: id
  reviewer_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) -- Foreign key to users :: id
)

-- a  list of editors

editors (
  editor_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES users(id) -- Foreign key to users :: id
)
```

### Relationships

Create an array relationship named `reviewers` based on the foreign key
constraint `reviewers` :: `article_id` → `articles` :: `id`:

### Permissions

The following is an example summary of the access control requirements
for the `articles` table based on the above schema:

|            |        |     |          |     |        |     |
|------------|--------|-----|----------|-----|--------|-----|
| Columns of | author |     | reviewer |     | editor |     |

\+ the `article`
+------------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+ \| table \|
insert \| select \| update \| select \| update \| select \|
+=================+============+========+========+========+========+========+
\| id \| ✔ \| ✔ \| ✖ \| ✔ \| ✖ \| ✔ \|
+-----------------+------------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
\| title \| ✔ \| ✔ \| ✔ \| ✔ \| ✔ \| ✔ \|
+-----------------+------------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
\| author_id \| ✔ <sup>\*</sup> \| ✔ \| ✖ \| ✔ \| ✖ \| ✔ \|
+-----------------+------------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
\| is_reviewed \| ✖ \| ✔ \| ✔ \| ✔ \| ✔ \| ✔ \|
+-----------------+------------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+

+-----------------+------------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+

+-----------------+------------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
✖ \| ✖ \| ✖ \| ✖ \| ✔ \| ✔ \|
+-----------------+------------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+

<sup>\*</sup> *Additional restriction required to ensure that a user
with the role* `author` *can submit only their own article i.e.*
`author_id` *should be the same as the user's id*.

We'll create permission rules for the roles and actions listed above
(*you can easily extend them for the actions not documented here*) .

#### Permissions for role `author`

-   **Allow users with the role** `author` **to insert only their own
    articles**

    For this permission rule, we'll make use of two features of the
    GraphQL engine's permissions system:

    1.  `Column-level permissions<col-level-permissions>`: Restrict
        access to certain columns only.
    2.  `Column presets <column_presets>`: Session-variable-based column
        preset for the `author_id` column to automatically insert the
        user's ID i.e. the `X-Hasura-User-Id` session-variable's value.
        It also helps us avoid explicitly passing the user's ID in the
        insert mutation.

    <div class="thumbnail" alt="Permissions for the role author">

    /img/graphql/core/auth/multirole-example-author-insert.png

    </div>

    Notice how we don't need to have an explicit row-level permission
    (*a custom check*) as only authenticated users with the role
    `author` can perform this action. As we have a column preset for the
    `author_id` column that automatically takes the author's ID (*and
    the* `id` *column is an auto-increment integer field*), we only need
    to allow access to the `title` column.

-   **Allow users with the role** `author` **to select certain columns
    only**

    Again, we'll use **column-level** permissions to restrict access to
    certain columns. Additionally, we need to define row-level
    permissions (*a custom check*) to restrict access to only those
    articles authored by the current user:

    <div class="thumbnail" alt="Column access for the role author">

    /img/graphql/core/auth/multirole-example-author-select.png

    </div>

    The row-level permission rule shown here translates to "*if the
    value in the* `author_id` *column of this row is equal to the user's
    ID i.e. the* `X-Hasura-User-Id` *session-variable's value, allow
    access to it*".

#### Permissions for role `reviewer`

-   **Allow users with the role** `reviewer` **to update articles
    assigned to them for reviews**

    For this use-case, we'll use
    `relationship or nested-object permissions<relationships-in-permissions>`
    based on the array relationship `reviewers` to restrict access to
    assigned articles only.

    <div class="thumbnail" alt="Permissions for the role reviewer">

    /img/graphql/core/auth/multirole-example-reviewer-update.png

    </div>

    The array-relationship based permission rule in the above image
    reads as "*if the ID of any reviewer assigned to this article is
    equal to the user's ID i.e. the* `X-Hasura-User-Id`
    *session-variable's value, allow access to it*". The columns' access
    is restricted using the column-level permissions highlighted above.

-   **Allow users with the role** `reviewer` **to select articles
    assigned to them for reviews**

    This permission rule is pretty much the same as the one for update,
    the only difference being the column-level permissions.

    <div class="thumbnail" alt="Column access for the role reviewer">

    /img/graphql/core/auth/multirole-example-reviewer-select.png

    </div>

#### Permissions for role `editor`

-   **Allow editors to select any article's data**

    This is a straightforward rule - there's no need for any row-level
    permissions since editors have access to all rows and they can
    *read* all columns.

    <div class="thumbnail" alt="Permissions for the role editor">

    /img/graphql/core/auth/multirole-example-editor-select.png

    </div>

-   **Allow editors to update an article**

    There's no need for row-level permissions in this case either but we
    need to restrict access to certain columns only:

    <div class="thumbnail" alt="Column access for the role editor">

    /img/graphql/core/auth/multirole-example-editor-update.png

    </div>
