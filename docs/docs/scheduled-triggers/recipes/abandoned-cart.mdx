# Send an Abandoned Cart Reminder Email using Scheduled Triggers

## Introduction

Scheduled Triggers allow you to schedule business logic to occur at specific times or intervals.

In this guide, we'll show how to use Scheduled Triggers to send an email reminder to a customer who has added products
to their cart but hasn't checked out within one day, otherwise known as an abandoned cart.

The trigger will be executed every hour to check if a user has a cart that hasn't been updated for 24 hours and hasn't
already received a reminder. If true, we'll send them an email.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

- A Hasura project, either [locally](/getting-started/docker-simple.mdx) or using
  [Hasura Cloud](https://cloud.hasura.io/?skip_onboarding=true).
- A working SMTP server or an email-sending service if you really do want to send emails. We will send to Ethereal Mail,
  a mock email service in this demo, but to actually send email you could use a
  [Gmail account](https://support.google.com/a/answer/176600?hl=en) if you have one or a service such as
  [Postmark](https://postmarkapp.com/).
- If you plan on using a webhook endpoint hosted on your own machine with a Hasura project hosted elsewhere, make sure
  you have a tunneling service like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) set up so a remotely hosted instance can communicate
  with your local machine.

## Our Model

When sending transactional emails like this, consider three essential components:

- **Your data source**: Which table in your database contains the value that you will use to determine whether to send
  the email?
- **Your querying logic**: How will your webhook query your database to decide whether to send the email? How will it
  return information so that you have the correct data to include in the email?
- **Your email templating**: How will you generate and send the email containing the information you want to send?

In this example, we assume there are three tables in our database: `cart`, `products`, and `users`.

The `cart` table
contains details of all products added to the cart by users, including the product ID, customer ID, and the last
modified date which we'll use to determine when a user last interacted with the cart.

The `products` table contains
the details of all products, including the product name and description.

The `users` table contains the details of
all users, including the user's email address.

<details>
<summary>

</summary>

```sql
-- Create the 'users' table
CREATE TABLE public.users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    email TEXT NOT NULL
);

-- Create the 'products' table
CREATE TABLE public.products (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT
);

-- Create the 'cart' table
CREATE TABLE public.carts (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    is_reminder_sent BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES public.users (id)
);

-- Create the 'cart_items' table
CREATE TABLE public.cart_items (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    product_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    cart_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    quantity INTEGER NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES public.products (id),
    FOREIGN KEY (cart_id) REFERENCES public.carts (id)
);

-- Seed data for the 'users' table
INSERT INTO public.users (name, email) VALUES
    ('Lewis Hamilton', 'user1@example.com'),
    ('Max Verstappen', 'user2@example.com'),
    ('George Russell', 'user3@example.com');

-- Seed data for the 'products' table
INSERT INTO public.products (name, description) VALUES
    ('Product A', 'Description for Product A'),
    ('Product B', 'Description for Product B'),
    ('Product C', 'Description for Product C');

-- Seed data for the 'cart' table
INSERT INTO public.carts (user_id) VALUES
    (1),
    (2),
    (3),
    (2);

-- Insert 10 items into the 'cart_items' table, each with an updated_at time that's more than a day old.
INSERT INTO public.cart_items (updated_at, product_id, cart_id, quantity) VALUES
  (NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day', 1, 1, 1),
  (NOW() - INTERVAL '2 day', 2, 1, 2),
  (NOW() - INTERVAL '3 day', 3, 1, 3),
  (NOW() - INTERVAL '4 day', 1, 2, 1),
  (NOW() - INTERVAL '5 day', 2, 2, 2),
  (NOW() - INTERVAL '6 day', 3, 2, 3),
  (NOW() - INTERVAL '7 day', 1, 3, 1),
  (NOW() - INTERVAL '8 day', 2, 3, 2),
  (NOW() - INTERVAL '9 day', 3, 3, 3),
  (NOW() - INTERVAL '10 day', 1, 4, 1);
```

You can copy / paste this into the `RUN SQL` tab in the Hasura Console on the `Data` page. Then, track all relationships
under the `Public` schema on the `Data` page. This will identify the foreign key relationships between the tables and
use them in the GraphQL schema.

**For any cart that is not checked out, do make sure to change the `updated_at` date to a day before the current date.**

## Step 1: Create the Scheduled Event

Go to your Hasura Console and click the "Events" tab. From there, click on the `Cron Triggers` item in the sidebar.
Then, click `Create`:

  alt="Hasura Scheduled Trigger architecture"
  width="1000"
/>

## Step 2: Configure the Scheduled Event

First, provide a name for your trigger, for example, `send_abandoned_cart_email`. Enter a webhook URL that will be
called when the scheduled event is triggered. This URL should point to the logic you've implemented to:

- Query the database for users who have abandoned their carts
- Generate the reminder email
- Send the email to the correct users

In the example below, if we're using Docker, we'll use a webhook endpoint hosted on our own machine running on port
`4000`. Let's enter the following URL to allow Docker to communicate with the host machine:

```
http://host.docker.internal:4000/abandoned-cart
```

:::info Tunneling your webhook endpoint

If you're not running your Hasura instance on the same machine as your webhook endpoint, you'll need to use a tunneling
service such as [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to expose your webhook endpoint to the internet. This will allow you to
expose a public URL that will forward requests to your local machine and the server we'll configure below.

You'll need to modify your webhook URL to use the public URL provided by ngrok.

:::

In the Cron Schedule field, set the cron expression to `0 * * * *`, which means the trigger will be
activated every hour.

Our trigger must also have a payload. This payload will be sent to the webhook endpoint when the event is triggered. We
don't have to include any data in the payload, but we can if we want to. In this example, we'll simply send a
`trigger_type` property categorizing the event as a `review_requests`. In the `Payload` section, enter the following:

```json
{
  "trigger_type": "review_requests"
}
```

Under `Advanced Settings`, we can configure the headers that will be sent with the request. We'll add an
`authentication` header to prevent abuse of the endpoint and ensure that only Hasura can trigger the event. Set the
`Key` as `secret-authorization-string` and the `Value` as `super_secret_string_123`.

<Thumbnail
  src="/img/scheduled-triggers/scheduled-triggers_recipes_review-request_auth-header.png"
  alt="Hasura Scheduled Trigger architecture"
  width="1000"
/>

Finally, click the "Add Cron Trigger" button to create the Scheduled Event.

## Step 3: Implement the Webhook

Your webhook can be a simple HTTP server that performs the desired tasks. It could be written in any programming
language or framework you prefer. The webhook needs to do three main things when triggered:

1. Query the database to find users who have items in their cart that were added over 24 hours ago and haven't completed the checkout process.
2. For each user found, generate a reminder email containing the product details.
3. Send the email.

Here's an example implementation using Node.js and Express:

<details>
<summary>
Then, create a new file called <code>index.js</code> and add the following code:
</summary>

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const nodemailer = require('nodemailer');

const app = express();

// Create a Nodemailer transporter using Ethereal email service
// Ideally, this configuration would be stored somewhere else
nodemailer.createTestAccount((err, account) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error('Failed to create a testing account. ' + err.message);
    return process.exit(1);
  }

  // If all goes as planned, here's the console telling us we're 👍
  console.log('Credentials obtained, listening on the webhook...');

  // Create a transporter object for nodemailer
  const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
    host: 'smtp.ethereal.email',
    port: 587,
    secure: false,
    auth: {
      user: account.user,
      pass: account.pass,
    },
  });

  // Our route for the webhook
  app.post('/abandoned-cart', async (req, res) => {
    // confirm the auth header is correct — ideally, you'd keep the secret in an environment variable
    const authHeader = req.headers['secret-authorization-string'];
    if (authHeader !== 'super_secret_string_123') {
      return res.status(401).json({
        message: 'Unauthorized',
      });
    }

    // get our date ready for the query
    const today = new Date();
    const aDayAgo = new Date(today.getTime() - 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);
    const formattedDate = aDayAgo.toISOString();

    // Fetch the data from our Hasura instance
    async function getRecentNoReminderCarts() {
      const response = await fetch('http://localhost:8080/v1/graphql', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
          'Content-Type': 'application/json',
          // "x-hasura-admin-secret": "<YOUR_ADMIN_SECRET>",
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
          query: `
            query EmailsOfUsersWithAbandonedCarts($updated_date: timestamp!) {
              carts(where: {_and: {is_reminder_sent: {_eq: false}, cart_items: {updated_at: {_lt: $updated_date}}}}) {
                id
                created_at
                user_id
                is_reminder_sent
                user {
                  id
                  email
                  name
                }
              }
            }
          `,
          variables: {
            updated_date: formattedDate,
          },
        }),
      });
      const { data } = await response.json();
      const { carts } = data;
      return carts || [];
    }

    let carts = await getRecentNoReminderCarts();

    console.log('carts: ', JSON.stringify(carts, null, 2));

    // map over the data and send an email to each customer
    async function sendAbandonedCartReminders(carts) {
      let outcomes = [];
      for (let i = 0; i < carts.length; i++) {
        const cart = carts[i];
        // Create a message object
        const message = {
          from: 'SuperStore.com <sender@SuperStore.com>',
          to: `${cart.user.name} <${cart.user.email}>`,
          subject: `You've left items in your cart, ${cart.user.name.split(' ')[0]}!`,
          text: `Hi ${
            cart.user.name.split(' ')[0]
          }, it seems you've left some items in your cart. Don't forget to check out!`,
        };

        // Send the message using the Nodemailer transporter
        const info = await transporter.sendMail(message);

        // Log the message info
        console.log(`\nMessage sent to ${cart.user.name}: ${nodemailer.getTestMessageUrl(info)}`);

        // add the info to the outcomes array
        outcomes.push({
          messageId: info.messageId,
          previewUrl: nodemailer.getTestMessageUrl(info),
        });
      }
      return outcomes;
    }

    await sendAbandonedCartReminders(carts);

    // Return a JSON response to the client
    res.json({
      message: 'Abandoned cart reminders sent!',
    });

    // Here we would run a query to update the database to mark the carts as having received a reminder but we will
    // leave this out for ease of demonstration.
  });

  // Start the server
  app.listen(4000, () => {
    console.log('Server started on port 4000');
  });
});
```

</details>


This script connects to a Postgres database, finds the users who have abandoned their carts, generates a reminder email
for each user, and sends it. The script uses the [Nodemailer](https://nodemailer.com/about/) package to send emails.

## Step 4: Test your Setup

Now that your Scheduled Trigger and webhook are set up, you can test it by simulating an abandoned cart situation.

With your server running, Hasura should start hitting our endpoint. As we set our cron expression to `0 * * * *`, the
webhook will be triggered every hour. We don't want to wait that long to test it. For now, update the
expression to `* * * * *` to trigger the webhook every minute. Then, check out your invocation logs in the Hasura
Console to verify that the webhook was triggered successfully and your terminal to see the outputted information and
a handy link to a the mock email
