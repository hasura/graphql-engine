:::info Note

This is applicable only when upgrading from Lux/Helm version 0.1.x -> 0.2.x / 2.0.x.

:::

## Pre Install

Starting with the control plane version 0.2.x, docker images are access controlled. Credentials required to access these
[docker credentials] will be shared with you during the on-boarding.

Before starting the upgrade, configure private registry access with the following
[guide](/enterprise/control-plane/pulling-images.mdx).

## Installation

Install can be done via the usual installation commands with the following
[guide](/enterprise/control-plane/index.mdx).

## Post Install

- Remove deprecated services from cluster by running below,
  - kubectl delete ingress accounts
  - kubectl delete all -l app=cronjob
  - kubectl delete all -l app=accounts
- Reload metadata including remote schemas on data portal `http://<domain>/data/` or restart data service.
- Modify the server URL of existing projects in Projects Page to fix a `Launch Console` issue. The modification can be
  as simple as adding or removing a `\` at the end, `Save` and revert the same.
