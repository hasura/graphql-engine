Introduction
------------

Please find the changelog (includes features, bug fixes, breaking change notifications, etc) of Hasura Cloud versions here.

v2.0.0-cloud.11
---------------

- Server: Fix erroneous schema type for action output fields (fix #6631)
- Server: Introduce ``HASURA_GRAPHQL_GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT`` env var for server config. This configures the time (default: 60s) to wait for any in-flight scheduled events, event trigger events and async actions to complete before shutting down. After this time, any in-flight events will be marked as pending.
- Server: Fix a regression from V1 and allow string values for most Postgres column types
- Server: Sanitise event trigger and scheduled trigger logs to omit possibly sensitive request body and headers
- Server: Fix parsing of values for Postgres char columns (fix #6814)
- Server: Explaining/analyzing a query now works for mssql sources
- Server: Fix MSSQL multiplexed subscriptions (fix #6887)
- Server: Fix bug which prevented tables with the same name in different sources to be tracked after setting custom names
- Server: Include more detail in inconsistent metadata error messages (fix #6684)
- Server: Add node limits for GraphQL operations
- Console: Add union types to remote schema permissions
- CLI: Add ``-o``/``--output`` flag for metadata ``apply`` & ``export`` subcommands

  .. code-block:: bash

    # export metadata and write to stdout
    $ hasura metadata export -o json

- CLI: Add support for ``graphql_schema_introspection`` metadata object
- CLI: Fix applying migrations in a different environment after config v3 update (#6861)
- CLI: Fix bug caused by usage of space character in database name (#6852)
- CLI: Fix issues with generated filepaths in windows (#6813)

v2.0.0-cloud.10

- Server: Fix MSSQL table metadata SQL, return empty array for empty rows (fix #1226)
- Server: Aggregation fields are now supported on mssql
- Server: restore proper batching behavior in event trigger processing so that at most 2x batch events are checked out at a time
- Server: Fix regression ``on_conflict`` was missing in the schema for inserts in tables where the current user has no columns listed in their update permissions (fix #6804)
- Server: Fix one-to-one relationship bug which prevented adding one-to-one relationships which didn't have the same column name for target and source
- Server: Fix query execution of custom function containing a composite argument type
- Server: Fix a bug in query validation that would cause some queries using default variable values to be rejected (fix #6867)
- Server: Custom URI schemes are now supported in CORS config (fix #5818)

- Console: Fixes an issue where no schemas are listed on an MSSQL source
- Console: Fix missing headers in event trigger invocations page which logged out Cloud console
- CLI: Fix regression - ``metadata apply â€”dry-run`` was overwriting local metadata files with metadata on server when it should just display the differences.
- CLI: Add support for `api_limits` metadata object
- Dashboard: Add env var ``HASURA_GRAPHQL_V1_BOOLEAN_NULL_COLLAPSE`` (default: false)

v2.0.0-cloud.9
--------------

Server: All ``/query`` APIs now require admin privileges


v2.0.0-cloud.8
--------------

Server: Format the values of ``injectEventContext`` as hexadecimal string instead of integer (fix #6465)


v2.0.0-cloud.7
--------------

Support for 3D PostGIS Operators
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We now support the use of the functions ``ST_3DDWithin`` and ``ST_3DIntersects`` in boolean expressions.
Note that ``ST_3DIntersects`` requires PostGIS be `built with SFCGAL support <https://www.postgis.net/docs/manual-3.1/reference.html#reference_sfcgal>`_ which may depend on the PostGIS distribution used.

- Server: Format Tracing values inside trace_log to string.
- Server: Fix issue with scheduled trigger logs


v2.0.0-cloud.6
--------------

- Miscellaneous fixes


v2.0.0-cloud.5
--------------

- Console: Add request preview for REST endpoints


v2.0.0-cloud.4
--------------

Support for null values in boolean expressions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In v2, we introduced a breaking change, that aimed at fixing a `long-standing issue <https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/issues/704>`_: a null value in a boolean expression would always evaluate to ``True`` for all rows. For example, the following queries were all equivalent:

.. code-block:: graphql

   delete_users(where: {_id: {_eq: null}})  # field is null, which is as if it were omitted
   delete_users(where: {_id: {}})           # object is empty, evaluates to True for all rows
   delete_users(where: {})                  # object is empty, evaluates to True for all rows
   delete_users()                           # delete all users

This behaviour was unintuitive, and could be an unpleasant surprise for users that expected the first query to mean "delete all users for whom the id column is null". Therefore in v2, we changed the implementation of boolean operators to reject null values, as we deemed it safer:


.. code-block:: graphql

   delete_users(where: {_id: {_eq: null}})  # error: argument of _eq cannot be null

However, this change broke the workflows of [some of our users](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/issues/6660) who were relying on this property of boolean operators. This was used, for instance, to _conditionally_ enable a test:

.. code-block:: graphql

  query($isVerified: Boolean) {
    users(where: {_isVerified: {_eq: $isVerified}}) {
      name
    }
  }

- Console: Add custom_column_names to track_table request with replaced invalid characters
- Console: Add details button to the success notification to see inserted row

v2.0.0-cloud.3
--------------

Transactions for Postgres mutations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

With v2 came the introduction of heterogeneous execution: in one query or mutation, you can target different sources: it is possible, for instance, in one mutation, to both insert a row in a table in a table on Postgres and another row in another table on MSSQL:

.. code-block:: graphql

  mutation {
    # goes to Postgres
    insert_author_one(object: {name: "Simon Peyton Jones"}) {
      name
    }
  
    # goes to MSSQL
    insert_publication_one(object: {name: "Template meta-programming for Haskell"}) {
      name
    }
  }

However, heterogeneous execution has a cost: we can no longer run mutations as a transaction, given that each part may target a different database. This is a regression compared to v1.

While we want to fix this by offering, in the future, an explicit API that allows our users to choose when a series of mutations are executed as a transaction, for now we are introducing the following optimisation: when all the fields in a mutation target the same **Postgres** source, we will run them as a transaction like we would have in v1.

- Server: Add connection acquisition latency metrics for Postgres databases
- Server: Log the ``parametrized_query_hash`` value in ``http-log`` logs
- Server: Fix a bug preventing some MSSQL foreign key relationships from being tracked
- Console: Data sidebar bug fixes and improvements
- CLI: Fix seeds incorrectly being applied to databases in config-v3
- CLI: Add ``--all-databases`` flag for migrate apply, this allows applying migrations on all connected databases in one go
- Docs: Add Hasura v2 upgrade guide
- CI/CD: Add ``cli-migrations`` config-v3 image

v2.0.0-cloud.2
--------------

Breaking changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This version includes breaking changes from previous version (i.e ``v1.3.3-cloud.x``).

- **Multiple mutations in same request are not transactional**

  *UPDATE (since v2.0.0-cloud.3)*: For only Postgres data source, multiple fields in a mutation
  will be run in one transaction to preserve backwards compatibility.

- **Semantics of explicit "null" values in "where" filters have changed**

  According to the discussion in `issue 704 <https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine/issues/704#issuecomment-635571407>`_, an explicit ``null``
  value in a comparison input object will be treated as an error rather than resulting in the expression being evaluated to ``True``.

  For example: The mutation ``delete_users(where: {id: {_eq: $userId}}) { name }`` will yield an error if ``$userId`` is ``null`` instead of deleting
  all users.

  *UPDATE (since v2.0.0-cloud.10)*: The old behaviour can be enabled by setting an
  environment variable: ``HASURA_GRAPHQL_V1_BOOLEAN_NULL_COLLAPSE: true``.

- **Semantics of "null" join values in remote schema relationships have changed**

  In a remote schema relationship query, the remote schema will be queried when
  all of the joining arguments are not ``null`` values. When there are ``null`` value(s), the remote schema won't be queried and the response of
  the remote relationship field will be ``null``. Earlier, the remote schema was queried with the ``null`` value arguments and the response
  depended upon how the remote schema handled the ``null`` arguments but as per user feedback, this behaviour was clearly not expected.

- **Order of keys in objects passed as "order_by" operator inputs is not preserved**

  The ``order_by`` operator accepts an array of objects as input to allow ordering by multiple fields in a given order, i.e.
  ``[{field1: sortOrder}, {field2: sortOrder}]`` but it is also accepts a single object with multiple keys as an input,
  i.e. ``{field1: sortOrder, field2: sortOrder}``. In earlier versions, Hasura's query parsing logic used to maintain the order of keys in the
  input object and hence the appropriate ``order by`` clauses with the fields in the right order were generated .

  As the `GraphQL spec <http://spec.graphql.org/June2018/#sec-Input-Object-Values>`__ mentions that input object keys are unordered, Hasura v2.0's
  new and stricter query parsing logic doesn't maintain the order of keys in the input object taking away the guarantee of the generated ``order by``
  clauses to have the fields in the given order.

  For example: The query ``fetch_users(order_by: {age: desc, name: asc}) {id name age}`` which is intended to fetch users ordered by their age
  and then by their name is now not guaranteed to return results first ordered by age and then by their name as the ``order_by`` input is passed
  as an object. To achieve the expected behaviour, the following query ``fetch_users(order_by: [{age: desc}, {name: asc}]) {id name age}`` should
  be used which uses an array to define the order of fields to generate the appropriate ``order by`` clause.

- **Incompatibility with older Hasura version remote schemas**

  With v2.0, some of the auto-generated schema types have been extended. For example, ``String_comparison_exp`` has an additional ``regex`` input
  object field. This means if you have a Hasura API with an older Hasura version added as a remote schema then it will have a type conflict. You
  should upgrade all Hasura remote schemas to avoid such type conflicts.

- **Migrations are not executed under a single transaction**

  While applying multiple migrations, in earlier Hasura CLI versions all migration files were run under one transaction block. i.e. if any migration
  threw an error, all the previously successfully executed migrations would be rolled back. With Hasura CLI v2.0, each migration file is run in
  its own transaction block but all the migrations are not executed under one. i.e. if any migration throws an error, applying further migrations
  will be stopped but the other successfully executed migrations up till that point will not be rolled back.
